Please just call and ask, or if it isn't something you need right away, you can text, but I might not get that right away too.  

I am not a commercial operation, I make my home available to provide a safe, comfortable, reasonably priced place for people to stay, since I live in a nice location that thousands of people visit.  Occasionally, the cleaners, or I miss something.  I know, shocker right?

Don't be a jerk and just leave it in the review if it is something I could literally have solved in 30 seconds.

A lady asked for a step stool so her toddler could use the sink the other day, I said, ""wow, no one has ever asked, but I should have one of those.""   15 minutes later, and a trip to Lowe's, she had a step stool for her kid.  


People asked for lobster crackers, since I don't have them with the kitchen tools.  I said, ""hey, you are right, I should have those.""  So, I lent them the ones from my house, and 30 minutes later, and a trip to Christmas Tree Shops, Boom!  Everyone has lobster crackers and pickers with their kitchen stuff.


30 week pregnant lady wants to push the two twin beds together to make a king for her stay since the queen is not big enough?


Boom!  Hello Amazon, get me one of those convert kits for making two singles into a king, with a pad to cover the gap, and a topper to make it more comfortable.  Can I get that overnight?  Yeah, thanks.  


Just use your voice, let the host know.  Some of us really do want you to have a nice time.

adac8824-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Good Bye Airbnb! Its been a great 8 years!,"I have been a host on Airbnb for 8 years now, spanning three homes on two different islands, but it is now time that I say good-bye. Airbnb has been an amazing experience for me and my partner but we decided today that it was time to shut down our superhost 5 star hundred plus reviewed Airbnb.

When I started hosting, Airbnb was new and a fun concept for young budget travelers and a great way to make extra income, it soon became my partner's and I's sole income and we loved it! But lately its just been different, we have lost the love of hosting and it feels like we are just running a hotel. The community around airbnb that started years ago seems to be all but gone. In our rural neighborhood, airbnb's increased from just ours to now over 75! We are still getting well booked but the competitive vibe around it is just not fun anymore. Bottom line we just want our home back and for our space to just be our space.

We have met some amazing people and some even became friends through Airbnb. We have also had some horror stories, oh have we, and some funny ones too.  This last incident we had guests TEAR UP our yard with a jeep wrangler and I think that was just the last straw, but overall guests have been great, and Airbnb was always great to us as hosts.

&#x200B;

I am not quite sure why I am sharing this here but I just felt like I needed a sense of closure to all of this. Although it is a very independent job, I have thoroughly enjoyed lurking and posting to this subreddit, loved reading other host's tips, or just relating on shared experiences and crazy guests. It gave a sense of community where I had none.

&#x200B;

So thank you so much for all the good advice, community, and a place to vent! Also for any new hosts out there, feel free to reach out if you have any questions, I have learned a lot over the years and would love to share and pass down tips and techniques.

&#x200B;

adac913e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,My guest story for the day...,"So today, I get a booking at 3:05 PM for my private room for 2 nights. She requests to check in between 4 & 6 PM the same day. At 3:55 PM, I respond with a personal code and how to get in. (she already had the address in the confirmation). At 3:56 PM she enters. I get out of my room with a big smile on my face ""Oh my! That was fast, welcome!"" She is mad and answers ""well yes, I have been waiting outside that whole time"" and proceeds to badger me. I do not think she was expecting me to fight back. I told her ""get out"". 

What is wrong with people? Entering someone's home and starting shit at the front door for no reason will never end well. 

Here is my last message to her : 
Hello, I am on the phone with Airbnb and they are processing your refund. I will let you know when it is completed. 

Airbnb is a side job for most of us and we are not concierges. I responded within the hour which was fair. You said you would check in between 4 and 6 PM below. You got the code within the time frame you asked for.  Please do not forget you are in someone's home as a guest and leave your attitude at the door next time.

Airbnb decides to release 0 dollars of the security deposit to cover damages and to not remove his false, negative review. Airbnb support is dumpster juice trash.","TL:DR: My wife and I are superhosts that were taken advantage of by an individual that elected to host a large after-prom party in our home. Despite 500 dollar security deposit and at least 1440 of damages at the time of submitting the request, Airbnb decided upon 0 dollars of compensation.

Here's the summary of events submitted to Airbnb:  
""Kevin booked our house for himself, no additional guests, mentioning that he wanted to ""relax  for the weekend a quiet getaway"" and that he ""wanted a more comfortable space Other then a hotel"".   
  
Shortly after arriving our security door sensors would not stop going off. I followed to inspect what was going on with our exterior house camera. I could see numerous people entering and exiting the house repetitively. When I asked him about this, he said some friends coming to take him out.  
   
He then went to the security camera and moved it to point away from the front door and the exterior to obscure the on-goings. However, the door sensors continued to alert my phone virtually every few minutes for the next few of hours. Through the audio I could hear excessively loud music and numerous people interacting. I assumed a party of a 8, 12, hell maybe 20 at this point possibly?   
  
At this point I called Airbnb support who asked me to prove to them that he was having a party and that they would call him to check. Airbnb support, after speaking to Kevin, informed me that he said there wasn't a party. I asked them what to do from here. I waited for approximately half an hour for someone from Airbnb support to tell me to call the police.   
  
I did not want to call the police as I was apprehensive that it may be escalating the situation more than it needed to be. I drove to the house myself with my wife and a friend.  
  
When we arrived the street was overflowing with cars, with approximately 10-20 people outside. A large black school-bus type party bus was parked outside the house. Apparently, a local high school's senior prom had ended that night and this was a mixture of ex-graduates and recent graduates of Warren Central.  
  
After numerous people trying to obstruct me from trying to enter or view the property and stating that both no one knew a Kevin... or, even better, that I needed to get out of there because the owner of the house wasn't me, the group dispersed.   
  
How did I almost instantly get 50-70 young ""adults"" to exit the house? I said the police were coming.  
  
At this point, I enter the house after waiting for a clown-car like exodus of people to the most incredible amount of marijuana smoke to the point it obstructed vision. It still after massive cleaning slightly smells of pot but hopefully to the point a guest doesn't notice.  
  
About 7 or 8 men are still in the house telling me they are not leaving, that the house and party is paid for and there is no Kevin.   
  
Kevin then eventually comes downstairs and I tell him all of his guests have to get out and he's broken the contract. Kevin then informs me that he's ""not even going to lie"" and that ""it is what it is"" and he was sorry and would cover the damages of the house.   
  
Some of his friends have also now stood up and stepped towards me demanding ""their money"". I told them Kevin could get his money back from Airbnb, partially to defuse the situation and get these guys to exit.  
  
Somehow in addition to these guys downstairs, another group of about 10 to 12 also then come downstairs out of a small 10x10 room. One of the young men comments on his way out that I'm not going to like what I see up there.  
  
Sometime around now the police actually arrive due to the disturbance and party. I have elderly neighbors on one side with a cardiac condition and on the other a mother with 3 children including an infant. I'm sure they absolutely love me (and Kevin's friends) right now.  
  
At this point we go back and forth on Airbnb messaging regarding the damages. I have not even submitted all of the damages to this -- I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to update.   
  
The fact of the matter is I suspect Kevin won't pay anything and I won't receive anything beyond the security deposit so this is probably a giant waste of my time.  
  
Please read the chat history between us for the absurdity of him accepting blame and ""taking responsibility"" for the various damages -- to later try to back up and pretend like it was some small little gathering. Including when he references taking the down the party from social media as to try to get people to stop showing up to the house well after it ""ended"" and police arrived.  
  
I also have the audio of him talking about the lock breaking, the audio of him talking about trying to fake out the camera, audio clips of the party, small clips when the camera finally sort of slunk down and you could see pieces of the party before someone unplugs it and then after I arrived and plug it back in for the police arriving.  
  
Please let me know what you need or I can provide to recuperate any of these damages.  
  
Let me know if it, or how it is possible for us to recoup beyond the security deposit.""

adac95d0-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,I've been living in AirBnB's for over a year. Here are my four suggestions for hosts.,"Hello everyone.  Over the past year and a half, I've been living AirBnBs almost exclusively.  I've stayed in AirBnB's on two continents and in seven countries.  I've stayed in amazing apartments and a couple terrible dumps.  I wanted to share a few pieces of advice for hosts that I think can improve your guests' stay and your listings score.  Some of these are probably obvious, but I have seen many hosts that seem to have invested a lot of money and put a lot of work into their AirBnB fail on each of these points. 

1) Provide the guest with all the instructions someone arriving and living in the apartment for the first time would need.  Type these instructions out on a sheet of paper and post it on a wall in the apartment.  Things this should include are (at least) the WiFi password, where to throw out the trash, how any appliances work if not completely obvious, and how to access any amenities (pool, gym, laundry room, etc.).  The instructions should describe the preferred check out procedure, such as where to leave the keys.  Local information, like where the nearest grocery store, is also helpful.  You might also consider telling guests if the tap water in your area is safe to drink (if not, where the nearest place to buy bottled water is), whether it is safe to flush toilet paper in your plumbing, and other similar information that foreign travelers may not be familiar with.  If you can, translate these instructions into English (if that is not the local language) or whatever the foreign language is that your guests commonly speak.

2) Provide a number of keys that are commensurate with the number of guests that you advertise the apartment is capable of accommodating.  If you are expecting multiple guests, they will appreciate it if they all have their own key so they can come and go as they please.  If hosts provide only one key, guests risk getting locked out if they don't come and go together.  This is especially true if a host is offering a long term stay discount, such as a monthly discount.  People that are renting an apartment for a month together are going to want and expect to be able to come and go freely with their own key.  If a host is not able or don't want to provide keys for each guest, it's really helpful to say so in the listing.

3) The kitchen.  A major reason people rent an apartment on AirBnB instead of a hotel is to get a kitchen.  But this is one area that so many AirBnBs are really lacking in easily fixable ways.  Try and cook an actual meal or two in the kitchen yourself.  If you do, you will see what equipment the kitchen is missing, which may not be obvious.  So many AirBnBs do not have basic things like a knife, a couple of plates, a couple of bowls, a cutting board, a frying pan, a spatula, a pot, silverware, cups, a mug . . . .  I have bought each of these things on my own multiple times when I discovered that the AirBnB I was staying at, which purported to have a kitchen, lacked them.  It's very frustrating to rent a kitchen that comes with no plates, silverware, or bowls!  Some basic cooking supplies, like salt, pepper, and cooking oil are also very cheap and very appreciated (though not really expected).  If your ""kitchen"" is just a hotplate and a microwave, but no stove or oven, that's fine, but say so in the listing.

4) Send your guests clear directions and check in information the day before they arrive.  Do I have to ask a doorman for the key?  Should I message you when I arrive?  Should I just go up to the apartment?  Is there a keypad?  Guests don't want to have to message hosts and ask, or and they don't want to arrive at the apartment after a long flight without knowing how they are getting in.

adac985a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Is it just me, or does Airbnb suck more every year?","When I first started hosting 3 years ago, it was lovely. Guests were kind and clean, and airbnb was incredibly willing to be helpful in the case of a question. 

Yesterday my cleaning person told me my ""two guests"" essentially threw a party, vomit everywhere, they tore blinds out of the windows, they somehow got wax everywhere, all the furniture was moved all around the house, and the guests were still there when they arrived (three hours after checkout). 

I'm not in the country so I can't call, but the last 4-5 times I have tried to get Airbnb's help on something, they left me hanging for more than the promised 24 hours, even after follow up. I haven't heard back from Airbnb and when I messaged the guest she just said  my cleaning person was lying (despite photos).

This is not the first time a guest has been disrespectful either. Guests seem to becoming more and more entitled and expect a ""hotel experience"" rather than staying in your actual house. 

Airbnb takes a percentage of EVERY BOOKING. It kills me that they're charging a service fee when so often their ""service"" is to not intervene or help at all with guests that cause trouble. When I've messaged over the last year, their first response is always to tell you to figure it out yourself rather than helping solve the problem.

I no longer believe that if something major was to happen to my home, they would help me. Their ""up to $1 million USD promise"" is garbage, in my opinion. 

After three years of hosting, I have one more booking. Then this superhost is OUT. I will not be sharing my home with a platform that will not back me up when my stuff is damaged and disrespected. I will not be sharing my space with guests who will face no repercussions if they damage my things. 

Airbnb, you started as such a pure idea. Now you're just another money hungry company. Which is probably why every major city wants you out.

adaca39a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,The most outrageous guest ever,"So I recently started hosting (a couple months ago) - I had some good pictures taken of my apartment, wrote a nice listing description, etc., and put a price that is perhaps a little too cheap for what guests get - but then again, I thought of it as an ""introductory offer"". Then - all very good, had my first 5 visitors who were all interesting, friendly, clean and left 5-star reviews. I was heading for Superhost status I believed, and was really enjoying myself.

Then - my sixth guest: Seemed just as normal as any of the other visitors, all went smoothly, he left a very very positive WRITTEN review but I noticed that my ratings had taken a hit - so I, perhaps unprofessionally, reached out to him to ask him whether there was anything he had not liked but did not write into the review.

His answer blew my mind: 

> Hi XXX, no your listing was great, it was one of my favourite Airbnb stays ever! I just rate all good&cheap Airbnbs with one star so they won't have a basis to raise their prices later. That means I can come back and not pay a fortune! Best wishes!!

You have towels plus more towels in the linen closet,  blankets, extra blankets, extra pillows... EVERYTHING. I take my superhost status seriously and really do everything I can to provide anything I can think of. I even have a box in one of the cabinets with extra phone chargers, toothbrushes, combs, floss, shampoo, etc. in case someone forgets them. I REALLY try here.

No, I'm not bringing you extra towels. Are you kidding me? You're in the apartment! I'm not there! 

It's too cold? The thermostat is right there. Do whatever you want with the temperature. 

This bish just gave me 4 stars because ""I texted and messaged asking where I could find a corkscrew and it took 4 hours for her to respond."" and ""She did not come and switch fresh towels or make the beds.""

People. She messaged me at 2:48am. Are you kidding me? Is she for real with this? Over a corkscrew? That was in the silverware drawer the whole time, drunk ass?

As for the towels, what? There's a washing machine and I provide the laundry soap. Wash your shit if you want it clean. And the beds? Ok, I'm not even answering that because it's even more ridiculous than the corkscrew.

It also looks like the pipe to the shower head is developing a leak when the shower is on, just a few drips now but it will probably get worse. To save a significant amount of electricity and $, put a few gallons of water in the fridge and freezer, this will give it some thermal mass and it will run much less. Empty milk jugs work great. A night light in the living room would be a nice touch, I wanged my shin on the coffee table before we figured out the lights. All good, we gave 5 stars.

adacb718-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Long chore list despite cleaning fee.,"Why is it that the Airbnbs with the largest cleaning fees also tend to have the longest list of “chores” for us to do at checkout, and it also seems to be the ones that have the earliest checkouts. This one I’m in is ridiculous. It’s the basic - strip beds, wash dishes, tidy up- but also wash bedding and towels and hang to dry, clean counters and dust surfaces, sweep floors, spray down tub and more. Oh, and check out is 9am. I didn’t mind the early check out since I was leaving early anyway, but it would have been nice to be warned that I’d basically be cleaning the entire place despite the fee because I would have given it a hard pass. 

The most I’ve ever been asked to do by a host who charged no cleaning fee is to strip beds and wash dishes. I’m so over these cleaning fees and wish Airbnb would create the infrastructure to make variable rates to automatically include all costs in the fee we see while searching. And I want a limit on the things we are required to do before checkout. I’m about to just take the bad rating and not do a damn thing when I leave. I might even go crazy and leave a pillow on the floor or something.

Oh, and this place tells me I cannot eat Indian or Chinese food while staying here. Now I get not wanting food out of the kitchen or dining area, but deciding I can’t eat something specific because it “smells” and then wanting me to pretty much clean the entire place. Uh, no.

adacb8e4-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Almost wanted to issue a refund on this one for effort...,"2 Weeks Ago: Guest books for tonight and asks if they can checkin yesterday. I check their profile. Account is two years old with only a few bookings but all 5 stars and despite a couple mentions of communication issues, I OK the request because it fills in the only opening left for July.  I send them my standard welcome message and also explain the room is already booked for last night.  

1 week ago: Having not gotten any response, I message the guest and ask them if they know when they will be arriving so I can greet them and show them where all the beach supplies are and how to get to the beach. No response. 

3 days ago: Another followup asking if they have firmed up their travel plans. No response.  

Today after checkin time; Another followup message with no response. I tried reaching out via phone and text and got no response.  

At this point, I don’t want the people staying in my house if I can’t communicate with them. I call AirBNB and Resolution Center says they will contact the customer and call me back. 

An hour later, the guest calls me and pretends to not know what AirBNB is and proceeds to tell me that her credit card was stolen. I explain that you wouldn’t need to steal someone’s CC to book an AirBNB space for them but she just keeps insisting the CC was stolen. I call Support back and they confirm the same payment method was used on all 3 of her bookings dating back 2 years. Support wants to refund her for the stay. 

I counter with, “So tell me which scenario sounds more likely...”. 

1 - Someone stole the guest’s CC and hacked into her AirBNB account and booked a $300 room that they didn’t intend to use. 

Or...

2 - The guest realized after not booking for both nights that they could stay 10 miles inland and not on the beach for both nights for the same price as one night here and concocted this story about a stolen CC to try and get a refund. 

The support rep said she’ll call me back after speaking to her superior. 

Still waiting on that call.


**UPDATE**  

Resolution Center called back and said they were able to confirm that the reservation was made from the same IP address as both of her previous bookings and every single authentication to AirBNB she’s ever made. She also said that the Credit Card was a new card for her account and went through standard verification several days after she claimed the card was stolen. They were also able to confirm with her financial institution that her card was active and had not been reported stolen. 
Resolution Specialist cancelled on behalf of the guest, issued no refund and forwarded her account to some other department for review. 
Someone rebooked the room for tonight while I was typing up this update.

So much of it was unnecessary for a welcome message and an absolute information overload.

The message didn't even include any of the door codes, that had to be texted directly to us. 

Upon arrival and the host walking us through, I saw a shoe rack next to the front door and asked if we needed to remove our shoes.

Whenever a guest books, I send them a message asking if they read the listing, know they have booked a private room rather than an entire home and that they will be sharing the home with me and my partner.

This particular guest hadn't responded for a week, so I called Airbnb asking them to reach out to him. He told them over the phone that he knew he had booked a private room and that I would be there with my partner. He also sent a message through Airbnb confirming the same.

The day before check in, I received a call from Airbnb. Apparently the guest had a change of plans. He now needed an entire home rather than a private room as his girlfriend was now also staying and she wasn't comfortable with a private room.

Airbnb asked me if I would be willing to provide the guest with a full refund for a last minute cancellation due to his change of plans (I have a strict cancellation policy). I told them that I was willing to refund the nights I was able to get rebooked.

Nobody booked Tuesday, but I had a guest book the remaining five nights this morning.

Shortly after that booking, I received a request for money from the guest through the resolution centre. He is claiming that he should get a full refund as my listing said that it was an entire home when he booked. It doesn't and it's clearly stated three times that it is a private room in my home, where I live with my partner.

There's also the fact that he clearly stated to myself and Airbnb that he knew he had booked a private room and that he would be sharing the home with me and my partner.

I contacted Airbnb support and told them that, due to his attempt to scam Airbnb into providing him with a full refund by lying about my listing, I was withdrawing my offer to refund the nights that were rebooked. Airbnb agreed that this was fair and now the guest has ended up with nothing.

I told the guest when I declined his request that he would have had five nights refunded, but was now getting nothing due to his attempted scam. I can't review him to warn future hosts, but hopefully he will have learnt his lesson and won't try scamming any other hosts in future.

tl;dr

Guest booked my place for six nights. Had a change of plans the day before check in. I offered to refund the nights that were rebooked. Five of six nights get rebooked.

#2: Complained about it being ""dirty"" under furniture. ""Dirty"" meaning dust bunnies under the center of the bed. (8/24)

#4: Complaining that we only have Hulu, Amazon, Netflix and local channels as opposed to cable. (8/25)

#5: Dog finds a piece of broken glass under furniture. Calls emergency vet fearing dog got cut.  Vets informs them since the dog isn't bleeding it didn't get cut.  I ask ""Did you break glass?"" to which they say no. Do you have the piece of glass so I can see where its from?  ""No""   -  We do a pretty good job cleaning but we only sweep and mop under furniture a few times a month.  (8/25)

#6: Oven is moved and a dried up bug from god knows how long ago is found.  Guest stares blankly at me as I wonder ""why are we moving appliances?"" That oven hasn't been moved since it was installed. (8/25)

#7: Just spoke with their last host. Apparently they attempted to get a refund of $300 for ""slow internet"" and the host advised me they 100% are looking for problems to get a free stay.  Time to talk to support. 

#8:  Talked to Airbnb, they essentially said ""oy vey"" and ""document everything, if a guest doesn't inform Airbnb of a problem with a stay and continues to stay - they can no longer pursue a refund for that specific item. (8/25)

#9: Called my friendly neighborhood pest control guy, who just had an appointment cancel and a free hour.  Sent him in to remove the dead bug which was on display as if we were holding a wake.

They called me after I sent this message and apologized, then advised that they didn’t think they had to declare their child because she was so young. They asked if I could make an exception to which I declined. Then they apologized again and said they would be out within the hour. 

I felt guilty. They had just arrived from a 6hr drive, dropped off their stuff in the unit and were with their child at the near park when they received my message. 

Everything I’ve read on this sub has Taught me to stick to my rules at all costs but the human in me forced a yield. I called them back and said that although this is a major liability, I am making an exception given the circumstances. They were genuinely thankful and I didn’t lose the booking.

adacdad6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,The Magic Is Gone,"I  have been an AirBnb host for almost six years and I've met amazing  people through the platform. But because of changes in the company's  policies, my relationship may be ending. To wit, I am about to post this  on their site: (Please share if you feel it appropriate.)                                    

""I have been an AirBnb host since 2013. At  that time, AirBnb (at least publicly) defined itself as a matching  service for ""hosts"" with an extra room and ""guests"" looking for a  personal stay. As with a dating site, both parties were required to  submit profiles (school, work, interests, photographs) and there was no  punishment if a host declined a guest because they felt the guest would  not be a good fit. Guests expected to be housed not in a subway-tiled  apartment with a digital keypad, a Keruig, and minimal with-host  interaction, but in a child's former bedroom sharing a morning cuppa  with a good-hearted guide to the neighborhood.

As the company  ""matured,"" the ""entrepreneurial"" as opposed to ""sharing"" model lost out.  AirBnb encouraged (though it demurred from saying so directly) hosts to  buy properties expressly to rent them. The human connection was  discounted and the “consistent experience” was encouraged. Someplace  along the line, the profile requirement was eliminated and the algorithm  started punishing hosts who refused to embrace Instant Booking. If a  host has to cancel a reservation (except for a death, for which a  certificate is required) not only are they shamed online, but also lose  Superhost status for an entire year. If a host turns down a request,  they are required to fill out a form saying why they did so, or may even  be subject to an accusatory phone call from one of AirBnb’s live  employees. 

Recently AirBnb initiated a policy of not releasing a  guest’s photo until approved by a host. At this this point in the  process, hosts are goaded into accepting all comers.

In my  opinion, these actions hurt hosts who bought into AirBnb’s original  save-the-planet message—and I was one of them. I love hosting visitors,  but I also know only a certain demographic will enjoy what I have to  offer. I should be able to control who I invite into my house—with my  belonging and valuables—and me. (I had one guest-from-hell who broke not  only my clothes dryer but also several antique mementos, but AirBnb  made the process of filing a claim so onerous, I let it slide.)

A  year ago, after a dearth of booking requests, I noticed that my  listing—which has Superhost status and 73 5-star reviews--had been  demoted to the second-last page of listings in my city. When I was able  to get through to a live person at AirBnb I was given a vague answer  about being unable to explain how the algorithm worked.

And two  last things: Taking a cue from the airlines, AirBnb now lets hosts fudge  the prices on their listings by not taking  “cleaning fees” and  “service fees” into account until check out. I could play this game,  too, but it’s cynical. In the world I want to believe in, what you see  is what you get….no games: pricing transparency from the get go.

 Similarly, by encouraging off-site hosts into the market, AirBnb drives down  the income of it's long-standing members. Of course this works in their favor. 3% of two $50 rents nets AirBnB the same profit as 3% of one $100  rent--plus they get the added kick (from guests) of two booking fees.

 It bums me that I may have to sever my relationship with AirBnb. Over  the years I’ve met individuals who have become friends and colleagues.  I’ve made a little extra income. I’ve enjoyed the experience. But in the  way of all tech companies (it seems) idealism has given way to  cover-your-ass profit-making.

adacdf90-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Asked to leave late in the night middle of stay,"Apologies for the long and detailed text. A bit of a background, we are in Paris and it is our second day. On day one, the host welcomed us at the place, gave us all the instructions and left. All good no issues.

Day two - we (me and my wife) visited a whole bunch of touristy/non touristy spots (first time in Europe), walked all around and we were dead tired and jet lagged (coming from Western Canada) and came back to the room hoping to get some sleep. We got some groceries and dinner for the night and came back around 7:30 - 8:00 pm. The apartment's lock had been changed. FLAG!!!!!! We immediately contacted the host (8 PM) and sent pictures of the changed lock and the host was surprised that the locks were changed. Host informed it will be taken care of and will be on the way with the keys and said was sorry for the inconvenience caused. Host said that the actual landlord of the listing had changed the locks without the hosts knowledge and now notes that he is out of town and can't make it. But will send his brother to the spot to help out. 

9 PM - With an hour gone and still waiting for the keys, we decided to check with AirBNB and see how they could help in this situation. Informed them the details and got a response immediately back on the live chat with AirBNB support through the app. 

9:15 PM - Within 10-15 minutes a case manager is assigned from their end. Let's us know that the host will be contacted to resolve the issue. Case manager connects with host to follow up. We informed the case manager that all our stuff is stuck inside the room and with time working against us, we were running out of options and looking for suggestions as to what our next steps should be. Meanwhile hosts gets in touch and let's us know landlord is coming to the room to open the door and give us the keys. His brother is nearby to help.

9:30 PM - Airbnb case manager informs us that they have contacted the host and we will have our keys in 30 mins and so we were asked to wait for sometime. Giving the benefit of doubt we decided to wait and see. We are so tired at this point and with our stuff inside we weren't sure exactly how to approach this. Our best case was to get the keys and get some rest ASAP. We were in no mood to look for another place or move to another place. Case manager also let's us know that if keys arent available tonight, then AirBNB will ""assist"" in finding another place and possibly even booking a hotel is one of the options. We are also told that we will have to book the place ourselves and Airbnb will only assist and can't book on our behalf. Airbnb will look into other compensation from the host for the inconvenience caused. (Was super annoyed already, but with everything against us, had to be patient) 

As requested by Airbnb we waited another 30 mins. 

10 PM - still no key. Same follow up from host : landlord on the way with keys. Hosts brother is waiting by the apartment. Checked again with AirBNB support - still asks us to wait as someone is fast approaching with the key. 

10:20 PM - we are desperately seeking for some alternate accomodation for the night as its getting closer to midnight and we don't have anywhere to go not do we know anyone here. 

10:30 PM - Airbnb support texts - ""Hi,

I wanted to follow up here and confirm that a colleague of mine will be getting in touch with you soon. In the meantime, if you have any further details or change of circumstances, please feel free to reply to this email. 

Best,""

Looks like an automated/generic text but whatever. We are hoping to hear back from someone with alternate accomodation options or atleast some links to look at as suggested before. 

This is last text we got from the Airbnb support. 

10:45 PM - no keys. No clue about where we will stay or what will happen to our stuff. And no word from Airbnb.

Around 11, 11:15 PM - landlord comes to open the door we are relieved only to find out he wants us out immediately. Landlord gives us 15 minutes notice to leave the place. Even after multiple requests he is adamant that we get out of the place immediately. We are constantly updating Airbnb and yet not a single response or assistance to arrange alternate accomodation. 

11:30 PM - we are on the street, with no place to go. On the positive side, atleast we got all our stuff back. But still have to find some place for the night. Fortunately we had a local sim card with data and got super lucky as we were able to find something before midnight, 30 mins away from our current location. 

12:15 AM - we are still on our way to the new room we found. 

12:30 AM - reached the hotel. 

12:45 AM - 
After completing all the procedures, we finally get some much needed relief. Finished dinner and went to sleep. 

1:45 AM - 
new text from Airbnb support - 

""Hi,

 I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. This is Jazzie, one of the case managers here in Airbnb, I am sorry that you were not responded with your previous message, this justgott endorsed to me. I am glad that you were able to transfer to a hotel already.

Just a terrible terrible experience and wouldn't want anyone to go through this. Any guidance from similar past experiences might be useful.

I had a undergrad student stay for an internship, 71 days. Two weeks before checkout she said she was leaving a day early. Long term reservation so no refund for a day. On day 68, my daughter, made an announcement to the guests (all 4) that she would be cleaning including their rooms, all guests were gathered in the kitchen when she told them and no one said please do not. She vacuumed, dusted and made beds. This was on Wednesday August 7, 2019. There was liquid damage to a wood vanity. My daughter took pictures. I sent the photos to the guest on August 8. The guest asked about the refund for the extra day again. I told her she could check with Airbnb. She contacted Airbnb, the entire stay was canceled, she was refunded $1835 for the entire stay. $$1779.85 will be held from my future earnings and my account was threatened to be suspended. When I inquired about the cancellation I was told that I violated the Trust and Safety policy and that they take the Trust and Safety policy very seriously.

I don't get too many bookings as not many people visit this area. As most of my guests tend to be old couples, I also don't get many reviews. The listing makes enough money for me though as due to the lack of places to stay in the area, I charge a high price. The few reviews that have been left are all five star. That is until my most recent guest.

I hosted somebody on Saturday who was new to Airbnb. There was nothing remarkable about her profile at the time and I thought nothing of it.

When she checked out I was astounded at how immaculate the place was. It looked exactly like I had left it. Most of my guests keep the place clean, but the place is never left perfect. At the time I just thought this guest was exceptionally clean and I left her the five star review I thought she deserved. Then I read her review.

Her review claims that I wasn't at the train station where I arranged to pick her up from and that I told her to walk half a mile to meet me somewhere else instead. She then claims that instead of taking her to the rural retreat that she was looking forward to, I drove her to a run down flat in the nearest city. Apparently this flat that doesn't exist was extremely messy with stained walls and rubbish all over the floor which had attracted several rats. The guest claims that she sent me several text messages complaining about the flat and asking me to provide her with the listing she booked, but I ignored her, which resulted in her having to book a hotel for the night.

I was gobsmacked. I couldn't understand why a guest had left such a spiteful false review. I called Airbnb straight away. I was told that the review doesn't breach their policy, it doesn't matter that it's obviously false and they can't remove it. I was told that all I could do was leave a response explaining what really happened, so I did.

Jump ahead to Monday and there are now two Airbnbs in my village. The host is the guest who left me a false review. I called Airbnb and told them that the guest had clearly left me a false review to sabotage my listing so that customers would book her place rather than mine. I'm told that her review can't be deleted as it doesn't breach their policy and she hasn't done anything wrong.",1.0,107,1556594319.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/biyjqf/rival_host_sabotages_my_listing_with_fake_review/,True,58

As a host, I thought I was signing up for a different thing.","I'm done with hosting. It's no longer fun or worth my time and I put the blame entirely on AirBnB themselves.

They are training their customers to expect a hotel experience. And if that's what the people want, they are going to be dissatisfied by anything that's not exactly the same as a hotel.  This attitude has been reflected in the way that customers have reviewed my property over the past year vs previous years. Before this customers were very specifically looking for something that WASN'T a hotel so their expectations were way different. They appreciated that it was different because that's what they want.

Now they want a hotel. 

Half of my reviews have turned into some form of  ""The house was nice, the host was great, the neighbors were nice and helpful. It was a really great experience overall. Also I saw a bug. 1 star""

Which in and of itself is disappointed to read, but I get that people are going to feel the way they're going to feel.

The part that is making me close up shop is when this kind of thing is followed by up passive-aggressive emails from AirBnB letting me know that my listing is in danger of being removed and that any other negative reviews will likely result in what amounts to a suspension. Followed by ""tips"" that might as well come right from a Hilton employee handbook.

Well guess what. You can't suspend me, I quit. I'll bet it's going to be easier for me to find other people willing to pay me to stay in my property faster than you guys can find another property.

I predict AirBnB will be declaring bankruptcy followed by literally being purchased by Hilton for pennies on the dollar sometime in the future.

I purchased this home June 28th, 2018 at a Sheriff Sale Auction, it had been abandoned for 5-years.

I loved the neighborhood and knew it would be a great long term home for me, and convenient enough to be a successful AirBNB. I did the renovation trying to keep the original feel of the house while modernizing some aspects, and extending the size of the kitchen. So took a Black & White approach for the interior while keeping old light fixtures, wood floors, & original windows.

Any suggestions, thoughts and comments are appreciated.

When I bought the house the yard was over 1ft tall, and the backyard was home to a family of skunks. Inside the home was full of debris, much of it I put on the street and neighbors picked through and took home. I ripped out all the carpet and laminate to expose original wood floors (Fir & Oak) which I had sanded and refinished with a clear coat. The kitchen was small & ugly so I extended it towards the dining room, and did tile throughout that whole area. Updating the cabinets to solid wood white cabinets, quartz counter-tops, copper sink, stainless appliances, and extending the gas line to kitchen for oven/range, doing subway tile to the ceiling, and soon will install 2"" thick butcher block floating shelves on exterior facing walls.

Ongoing projects are:

Getting yard to look nice, building a 6' wood fence around backyard, repainting exterior, restoring old windows so they function, re-siding and re-roofing the garage, installing wood on spiral staircase, and fixing sprinkler system.",0.97,101,1558738807.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/bsnkwr/pictures_purchased_abandoned_house_for_airbnb/,True,33

We were there for two weeks and stayed in multiple places.  Because we were using this platform, we got to rent a flat at a working farm in the Cotswolds where we learned a lot about the life of the small farmer, an isolated 18th C. stone cottage with the most beautiful natural surroundings in Northern Wales, and a penthouse, waterfront, two story flat in London that was renting for $150 per night.

We had hosts who helped with directions, helped when our rental car's alarm went berserk and couldn't be shut off, left booze for cocktails for us, and in general, went out of their way to make sure our stays were really pleasant.

Was everything absolutely perfect at each place?  No, but overall it was a great experience for us.  We had space for our family, saved money by having access to kitchens, got to do a few loads of laundry so didn't have to overpack, and paid a lot less than we would have had we stayed in hotels.  And it was way more unique and memorable than any hotel stay could have been.

AirBNB’s response was you should speak to the host.,"Don’t do that, Support. Just read the cancellation policy to them and give them the numbers... in this instance, you booked one of the busiest weekends of the year several months ago and decided 3 days ahead of time that you didn’t like the forecast. You don’t get a refund. This is Florida during the summer. If I refunded every guest who had to endure rain during their stay, I wouldn’t have a business. 

I really don’t want to add “Haggle about the cancellation window” to the list of conversations I have with every guest. In this instance, a bad review is almost guaranteed because AirBNB made me be the bad guy.


UPDATE: My review of him was not good but it was not scathing and was completely factual. I gave him 1 star for Communication and Observance of House Rules and derailed in the review that he never said anything before leaving and that he booked for 2 adults, 2 children and 2 infants and showed up with 2 adults and four teenagers who were ~ 15/16. 

He replied to the review with a bald faced lie. He said, “Hist filled in the guest portion of the booking for me and the extra charge”.

Been a host for close to 3 years and a Super Host throughout.  I have hosted 100s of Guests at my 4.9 Star rated listing which has excellent reviews.

Right before I received the closure email I got a booking.  Shortly afterwards Airbnb sent me a message saying they cancelled the booking because it was fraudulent.  And then right after that the closure email came through and it said I was removed because the the payment for reservation number xxxx is fraudulent.  The reservation nbr they referred to matches the reservation that just got cancelled.  
Why did my account get blocked if a guest’s payment is allegedly fraudulent.  It has nothing to do with me.  Why am I being held liable for a guest’s payment?  I’m confused and can’t make sense of this.
Could it be they were trying to cancel this guest’s account and accidentally cancelled mine?  
I called customer service and was told they do not handle such issues and that the department that does handle such issues only communicate via email so they will escalate the issue to them.  I’m waiting for reply from them now.

Has anyone been in such a situation?  How did it  turn out.  
I have put a lot of time, money, effort into this place and if my account is not reinstated will end up putting a financial strain on me.

Guest fails to disclose child that is accompanying her and her husband. Unit has max occupancy of 2 and specifically mentions not child friendly. I asked them to leave due to liability concerns and a breach of the rules. They protest and I ultimately concede and allow them to stay. They left the place a mess I get a bad review as noted below.


Here’s their feedback:

The check-in process was very convenient and we were permitted to check in early. I checked in ‪around 1.30pm‬ and my 3 year old daughter and fiance arrived ‪around 2:30 pm‬. While we were at the park about an hour after they arrived, we received a message saying that we would have to leave and would be issued a refund because the host was unaware that we had a child as well. I traveled nearly 9 hours and was deeply saddened that I would have to find another place the last minute for my family to stay. However, Host decided to go ahead and let us stay for the weekend, but this left us feeling unwelcome and as if we had to walk on eggshells. It would have been expensive and difficult to find somewhere else to stay so we accepted his offer. I was very disappointed that we were asked to leave with no notice because of our 3 year old daughter. If you have smaller children, I would not recommend this place, but otherwise it was very stylish, spacious, and clean. I have no complaints about the actual place

Here’s what I’m thinking of replying back:

I’m sorry to hear about your experience. The listing specifically mentions that the unit is not child friendly as the fixtures can pose a potential danger to children under 4. During the booking process, I asked who was accompanying you during your stay and you made no mention of a child. I allowed an early check in and only came to know about a child after receiving a noise compliant from the tenants above. Despite being a breach of Airbnb rules, I offered a full refund and gave you time in the unit to source another rental. After you voiced concern about finding another place in time, I agreed to allow you and your family to stay for your entire booking period. 

Is this too harsh?

adacf700-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,I got a negative review- for not eating breakfast.,"I went to Paris for a week and booked an airbnb with an older couple. They advertised as a bed and breakfast and when I booked the listing, I thought I was getting two bedrooms; one for me, one for my friend. At some point I mentioned thi to the host and he told me I had misunderstood the ad and that it was just for one bedroom. If I wanted the other, it'd cost more. I decided to let the whole thing go since our host had been communicative and nice prior to our arrival. We went, stayed in the room, and that was all fine.

Throughout the stay, the hosts were perfectly nice and helpful. They gave us a lot of information and always willing to help us plan. But there were also language barrier issues that weren't apparent when we wrote back and forth online. Also, every day they wanted my friend and me to pick a time to have breakfast, and they were pretty forceful about it. The listing said they offered breakfast but that it was served between 6-9am, but every night when we arrived home they wanted us to set an exact time. For the first few days I had breakfast, but then I started to politely decline. The breakfast would last an hour, they seemed insistent to know our daily plans and to discuss them as well as to chitchat. By mid-week I was also exhausted from all the walking and traveling and I just didn't want to get up at a set time for breakfast. The ad said the breakfast was optional and not mandatory so I didn't think anything of this. Another issue was that they advertised as a bed and breakfast so I assumed more people would be there. It turns out if it was just a room in someone's home and they would just put out breakfast. We were the only guests.

There weren't any other issues. They were nice, we were nice, we said our goodbyes and left. I gave them a nice review and I read theirs. Turns out they gave me a negative review! They stated that I was nice and left their home clean, but they were disappointed that I declined breakfast and they found their experience with me disappointing. They said the only real communication they had was with my friend, who came down and had coffee with them more time than I did.

I contacted Airbnb. I couldn't honestly believe I got a bad review because I didn't eat their breakfast every day. I wasn't there for THEIR entertainment; I was there to rent a room in their home and stay there. I was clean, I was quiet, and I was nice. I was their to see the city, not to see them. And I was even willing to give them a nice review even though they misrepresented their place.

Am I right to be annoyed? I mean, I honestly am shocked that I was judged not by how i treated their home, but by the fact that I didn't sit and have breakfast with them every morning. Is this a thing now?  


tldr; Stayed with hosts for a week. Said they were a bed and breakfast but they weren't.

Had ""Richard"" arrive yesterday for his week's stay. He comes every year for a week at a time for two or three months for work. He is a gas line fitter on emergency calls. We're both pilots and quickly became good friends. When he arrived his place was ready, I put out an extra large bag of M&Ms because I remembered he has a sweet tooth and I had the BBQ fired up. We caught up in my space upstairs over dinner.  He installed a gas line for the BBQ last year at cost along with helped me install my dishwasher.  He also ran a gas line for a dryer the year prior, again for cost. This year we're looking at running a gas line to my backyard for a future patio project I have lined up. We're also looking at doing some landscaping at my place. I give him a great deal at my place, much cheaper then he can get elsewhere and he gets more then other guests get (access to the BBQ, SNES and NES video game consoles, extra snacks etc).  He treats my place with respect and I appreciate the extra help.  

Just want to say to those guests and hosts out there that positive experiences do occur and friendships are made via this platform. If you had a rough experience recently don't forget positive ones occur as well. ",0.96,97,1537359887.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/9h4oie/positive_airbnb_story/,True,5

adacfbf6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Trashy guests get honestly reviewed, insert surprised Pikachu face","It's long....TLDR at bottom.

Had 3 girls stay at our place a few weeks back. They were ending a long adventure holiday in my country before embarking on another long adventure holiday in a different part of the world. 


Communication was just ok, they were out most of the time, no problems during their stay. Seemed like good guests. 


My house rules are pretty simple and must be agreed upon before booking - take everything belonging to them with them when they leave. House manual goes into a bit more detail about where to put the trash, don't leave food behind, ventilate the property, take everything with you. You get the idea.


I was at work when they checked out. Got a message from them saying ""we had a great stay and by the way sorry about the bags of trash we left, also we left some food that we hope you or someone will eat"". Okay. Not sure what to expect when I get back home to turnover the room.  


On the doorstep is some swimming equipment they've dumped. I go into the room and the first thing I notice is the smell. The windows and doors have been shut for 2 days. Yep, there's the two BIG bags stuffed full of trash and rotting food just inside the door. Perfect in the stinking hot summer we've had. There's more food on the kitchen bench. Half eaten food mind you. Open the fridge to more of the same. Oh yummy a half eaten tub of hummus and a plethora of other shit food that has been opened and been exposed to who knows what. You're a real generous god Ms  Guest. Dishes piled on the sink. Hair, pencils, cotton buds, string, paper, stickers, and all manner of other little trashy bits and pieces in every nook and cranny of the studio apartment. What the actual f.


What should have been a 45min to 1 hour clean took closer to 3 hours and some serious ventilating to return the room to a habitable state ready for the next guest's arrival the following day.


I looked at the guest profile and sure enough it's all generic copy pasta reviews from previous host's. A trust platform works best when honest reviews are given, right?


Maybe this visit was an anomaly for the guests. Maybe they really are clean and great guests every other time. Or maybe it's time they received an honest review so I don't pass on a trashy guest to the next host unfortunate enough to receive a booking from them. 


So, I wrote an honest, unemotional review stating the facts. Said what they did well and then said they left behind trash and half eaten food which went against the house rules agreed upon when booking. Stated that an additional 2 hours of cleaning time to make good. Fair and factual.


Yesterday, I received an Airbnb message from the guest saying they didn't appreciate the negative review and how dare I say such things when they only left 1 bag of trash behind. So delusional!!! 



You can't reason with the unreasonable so I hit that report button hard.  Bye Felicia.

adacff2a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,I’m sure that my AirBnB Host is Secretly Recording My Boyfriend and I,"My boyfriend and I moved cross-country, and we’re staying at an AirBnb long-term while looking for housing. The ‘honeymoon’ period passed, and we did start to complain privately in our bedroom when the host wasn’t home. (These weren’t big complaints - obviously we would have gone to the host if we had any real issues). After a few weeks, we realized that whenever we complained about something while talking in the bedroom (host not home), she would bring up the issue upon arriving home or the following day. Even if we complained about three things in one day, they would all be brought up that evening in the 5 to 10 minutes of conversation we had with her. (We usually only speak with the host for 5 - 15 minutes a day). This wasn’t just with complaints though. We’ve also discussed our financial situations, jobs, and other topics, and she has also been brought these things up (although less often).

I didn’t mention it to my boyfriend at first, because I thought I was just being paranoid; but then he took me out to lunch to tell me HE was suspicious that there could be recording devices in the room. We decided to stop complaining / gossiping in the bedroom and not discuss sensitive or private matters anymore. Even with this severe reduction in conversation topics and conversation overall, she still mentions small things we’ve discussed.

I’ve visually scanned the room and haven’t found anything yet. I realize that listening devices can be hid much better than cameras (although those also get VERY small and easy to hide). It’s frustrating since I’m nearly 100% sure I’m being recorded, but I’m unable to find the hard evidence. Obviously, if she is recording us, this is illegal and a huge violation of privacy.

Does anyone have any advice on how to find listening devices? We don’t have the money to get a bug-detector. I’ve read plenty of online articles and took some of their advice (like downloading Fing to see what devices are connected to the internet). I’ve tried using an app on my phone that’s supposed to detect infrared cameras in the dark, but I think they’re just listening bugs, not cameras.",0.96,93,1551369123.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/avsl8x/im_sure_that_my_airbnb_host_is_secretly_recording/,True,55
adad00b0-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Just accepted my last reservation! Signing off in October.,"We've been hosts for the last 6 years, across 3 houses in 2 cities (all of which we also lived in).  I'm grateful for the opportunity to subsidize rent, save up a down payment, and subsidize mortgage along the way.  We also hosted hundreds of people from every corner of the Earth.  We've had Austin hippies build blanket forts, South Africans cook for us, and a very confused chinese couple wash their feet in the toilet. Our experiences with guests were 99.2% great (by the numbers).  We also just managed to crest back up from 4.9 to a 5.0 overall average last month (meaning the real number is probably 4.95 rounded up)... across all that time, which is a great cherry on top of our retirement.

Anyway, what you all care about... Why?  There are many reasons, but here are the top 3:

* **We have a baby now and she makes a lot of noise**, it's only a matter of time before our guests go from ""So cute! OMG"" to ""So loud... omg.""  We can also use the house space where we couldn't before.
* **The writing is on the wall, the ride is over.** On Airbnb's end, the new acceptance rate which would effectively end our business, when they decide to enforce it.  Matching guests to the right hosts is ultimately what leads to a great experience, for both of us.  We do that, at our expense.  We also have to turn people away with dogs, extra guests that don't fit, people asking about long-term housing, etc.  We have to tell older folks that there is a flight of stairs, and a clawfoot tub, they don't read our description.  We get wedding photo requests, commercial solicitation, all sorts of bullshit that we don't ask for which makes our acceptance rate drop.  We can't control those requests, and I'm not doing the accept-and-call-to-cancel, the time overhead to do so would be ridiculous.  Fix your policy, or make your platform better at matchmaking.  
Other than that, Airbnb is actively out to devalue homeshare hosts as they scale for an IPO.  Originally they did it in Seattle where we used to host. They ran MASSIVE radio, youtube, TV campaigns featuring this [darling Asian family!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFxgqil6vU4)... later that summer our price elasticity had fallen at least 20%.  We got the fuck out of that city though thankfully.  Their new IPO-seeking focus is on joint partnerships with [boutique hotels, developers](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/12/airbnb-is-teaming-up-to-build-a-home-sharing-complex-in-florida.html), and 21st century travel agencies (i.e. the new Experiences).  The resolution cases I have been privy to as both a host, and guest have always skewed toward the guest.  The host guarantee is a joke.  In short, they are slowly abandoning their ""Airbed and Breakfast"" origin story in favor of commercial operators.  Money talks.  Bullshit walks. 
* **Our bottom line is a joke now, for the amount of time and risk we put in.**  Our county now takes ~20% of our gross revenue (via a yearly fixed permit cost), itemizes a *personal property tax*, and incurs an additional 8% occupancy tax to guests.  That's almost a third of our profit, and that is PRE-INCOME TAX.  If a guest pays airbnb/occupancy at $100, by the time we have paid out all the other hands including operational costs and insurance, we see $32.33 of it.  Not worth it.  I know what some of you are thinking... **Even if we raised our prices 50% to compensate, we would now see $39.25**, still not worth it.  This is the dark side of what can and will happen in other areas with Draconian regulation AND supply-side pressure. (The occupancy tax I agree with, for what it's worth, and it's fair for both hotels and STRs to incur this.)

Given that ROI and outlook, we'll take our house back.  And that's the plan, in 4 months!  Best of luck to all of you continuing to host.  We'll be staying with you when we travel, as we still love the idea of Airbnb over hotels.",0.98,94,1528731362.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8qah52/just_accepted_my_last_reservation_signing_off_in/,True,38

So I'm sure it's entirely coincidental that I just got a message that one of my plus listings is being removed from the program due to "" several reports of significant issues"".  Here were the issues they cited--one guest had a wifi issue (in August), a knob broke off a stove (which is fairly new, about 6 months old) in July, and one guest said maybe she might have smelled mildew in the bathroom (no specific date given).  But they said I can re-apply for plus again, obviously it would be under the new 6% fee program.

My guess is they're going to find any reason they can to get rid of all the existing plus listings to force them to sign up at the 6% fee.  Keep in mind these weren't issues guests reported, but simply things they told me in our message threads, so they're clearly combing over all your messages to try to find problems to use as excuses to kick people out of plus so they have to re-join.

Personally I'm going to tell all my other plus listing guests to text me with any issues for a faster response otherwise I'm guessing any problem no matter how small will be  used as excuses for removing the listing from plus.",0.99,90,1568847402.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/d6529o/be_very_very_careful_with_your_airbnb_plus/,True,61

Already had the unit turned over so I figured okay cool, let’s do this! Guest had government ID, phone number and all other possible validations. Easy check-in no hassle, I go to bed.

The next morning I wake up and saw I had WAY too many notifications from my Arlo camera in the public hallway of my apartment complex. Nothing alarming at first until I see there’s 15 men going in and out of my unit around 2AM, my heart sank; the booking was for 1 guest.

Something didn’t seem right until I noticed that one man was taking my AC unit out of the unit, another a large painting, then my lamps were coming out one by one. The guest never returned my keys.

I feel unsafe and just overall depressed being in my own home. They stole records, my Xbox, iPhone that I leave for guests to control the lights with, projector, sound bar, plates, silverware, magazines.

Coming back into the unit they put their cigarettes and blunts out on my tables and counters, spilled drinks like they were celebrating a championship in a locker room, it legitimately smells like they pooped somewhere in the unit.  

I run several units and thoroughly enjoy making people’s stay here in the city enjoyable and a one of a kind experience. I’m absolutely shocked that this group of people thought this was okay and furthermore, committed theft while a camera is right in view.

Periodically, I get people who arrive and are instantly dismayed that this isn't a hotel. It's not often. But it does happen. That I had my place professional photographed and try to communicate with guests as professionally as possible can, I admit, give the impression that this is something more than you renting the cottage on the back end of my yard. Still, the bulk of these folks do end up staying and often just don't leave a review.

Two days ago I checked in a lovely couple who, it was very clear, expected a five star hotel despite my very clear listing. The place was freshly cleaned. They got it, in fact, after my monthly deep clean and just a few days after my quarterly pest service. But this coupled showed up to a rural cottage wearing very expensive clothes in a very expensive car and were asking questions about amenities and services that I don't think are offered anywhere in the county, let alone at my AirBnB.

Laundry service? Hey, the washer and dryer are right over there, help yourself. Gourmet dinners? I'd be happy to recommend you a place in town. 

They were a very polite Indian couple who went through the full reservation process with my wife (also Indian). I think they were also taken aback when her white as snow husband showed up to lead them around. Here's the door code, let me know if you need anything. 

OK, they said, they were just going to go grab some dinner and then come back. OK, whatever.

My wife looks at me and says ""I don't think they're coming back."" 

Sure enough, it was clear by the following morning that they weren't returning. As they only had a two day stay, I wasn't too worried. I don't get a lot of walk-offs, but they do occur. If you tell me nicely how this isn't what you expected, I'll very often refund at least part of the stay (unless it's a weekend, because then you wasted one of my prime booking times). 

But walkoffs get no refund. As far as I'm concerned, you can return at any moment, the space is reserved for you. I have no idea if you went to stay at the Hampton Inn or if you just got lucky at the local bar and will be home shortly to shower and shave.

That, of course, was also what I said to them when, days after their reservation ended, they came seeking a full refund since they never stayed. No folks. First, you check in before my stated check-in hours, then you ""went to get some dinner and would return"" and never do. You booked the place. Don't want to face me? Send me a message in app requesting a refund and I'll give you the second night back. Walk off and don't communicate until you open a case?

adad0ee8-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Ideas for hosts here! I’m a 5-year Airbnb host who is also a superhost. I experienced being a guest with Airbnb for the first time this past weekend. I got a bunch of new ideas to share!,"I host in a city in the mid-Atlantic region, in a row house in a working class black neighborhood, as a single white woman with her dog. I’ve lived in this house for almost 13 years. I know my neighbors. Seen neighbor kids grow up. Good times. 

I’ve been hosting for 5 years with mostly positive experiences. Most of the negative experiences are because of guests who disregard rules. 

I stayed as a guest at an Airbnb in another part of the state this past weekend. After hosting for so long, and making sure my listings are working for me, I gained new perspective as a guest.

I noticed all the little things. It was a last minute booking and she was decidedly non-plussed about it, which helped because I was nervous about booking on such short notice. It was a change of plans for me to need a place to stay. 

She gave me only the information I needed at the beginning, which was how to get in, where my bedroom was and who would be greeting me. 

I got there and wasn’t surprised to see her son, my greeter, since she told me about that ahead of time. I don’t like surprises, which isn’t anything she could know, but got what I needed anyway, no surprises. It allowed me to begin my brief stay more comfortably. The first thing he did was show me my room, which I just wanted to see, mostly to know where my touchpoint in the house was, where I could retreat to. 

I am a smoker and asked him right away, if there was a spot on the property where I could smoke. He directed me to the porches and I sat there to smoke. He said to just put the cigarette butts in the trash, so that’s what I did, but...I know how much those can smell up a trash can. I kind of wished there had been something I could ash into and out my cigarette butt in on the porch. It felt awkward to bring it inside. 

There were a bunch of touches in the bedroom that were super sweet and, as a host, I recognized as going  above and beyond. There was a bowl of wrapped chocolates, a water glass and a pitcher of fresh water. The towels were rolled and on the bed. All these things together left me feeling like I was truly being pampered, and for $74/night. It all made me feel like I was secretly getting the best deal ever. 

There was a TV in the room with Roku. It was easy to use without any kind of manual (not sure I can say that for my house) and I was able to find a lot of options to watch a movie, in the privacy of my room. I wouldn’t have felt comfortable just joining she and her family if they were watching TV, but I did feel comfortable watching TV in my private bedroom in an unfamiliar house, if that makes sense.

There was a safety stick thing, for the inside of the bedroom door. It works by placing one end under the doorknob and the other end  in the ground, if that makes sense. It took me awhile to figure out what it was, but then I remembered. It prevents the door being opened from the hallway. 

I thought that was cool that it was there in the room, without explanation. If someone knew what it was, they could use it, as an extra layer of personal safety. They don’t have to use it, but it would be an option. I appreciated that. 

She had a white noise machine plugged in in the hallway. It was clever. It would ensure whether someone was a light sleeper or not, to be more likely to get a quiet’s night’s rest. 

Lastly, in the morning, I found a note in the bathroom from her that hadn’t been there the last time I was in there. Just where breakfast was stuff. I thought that was smart placement, for her to get a message to me in the am since the bathroom is where everyone goes on waking up. It was also a quiet way to get a breakfast info message to me instead of texting me, in case I was still sleeping. 

So, just a bunch of thoughtful things that added up to feelings of safety and comfortable. That’s how I want my guests to feel at my house, so it was good to feel that, and reflect on what the exact things were that made the most difference for me as a guest.

I've been a host for 4 years, and a superhost for much of it. Recently I lost my superhost status because of a spate of 4 star reviews plus one seriously unhappy dude who surprised us with a one star review after having stayed one night and not said a word about anything being wrong... but took issue with everything from the presence of a spider in his room to the walls not being good enough for him.  


Here's the problem: those 4 star reviews were from people who were HAPPY. They left me glowing words of praise, and four stars. Because in the rest of the world, 4 stars means ""great job!"" not ""you fail."" But with Airbnb where you have to have a rating of min. 4.7 stars average to keep operating (at least - I think this is my understanding - perhaps it is 4.5?) and a 4.8 star average in order to a superhost - these awesome people who love my home are killing me. When I get a 4 star review it shows up BLACK just like a one star review - I'm told I have had a low rating, and get warning messages. 5 star reviews show up as ""blue"" and happy and ""yay you did good, host""!  


Now, that's melodramatic. But this is seriously grating on me after this many years of working hard to provide a great experience and learn and grow from what guests tell me makes them happy.  


Here's the thing: I'm one of the hosts who gives newbies a chance. If they are willing to fill out their profile, prove their identity, and connect with even a modicum of communication skills, I give them a go. I know it's hard to get traction for new users without a review. Many hosts won't take a chance on them... and one of the reasons is because new guests don't know what to expect. I take MANY hits on reviews from first time users because they just don't know what this experience looks like, and they rate me as though their private room in a shared family home should have been like a hotel experience. But I roll with it, because overall everyone is happy.  


So I'm taking the risks for ""the team."" Because I'm a nice person and believe that the majority of people are awesome too. But I'm carrying all the bruises for doing so, and I'm not happy about that. I love the people, and hate the consequences my listings get.  


I've seen posts on here where hosts talk about educating their guests about how the rating system works. They leave notes in the room, or have conversations with them about it. None of that sits right with me, although I understand it and support those who do it... for me it would feel like asking for a tip. Or pressuring the guest to write a certain way.   


Frankly, that's not our job. If airbnb is not going to have their star system reflect the rest of the world's understanding of what 4 vs 5 star means, then for gods sake - EDUCATE YOUR USERS!!! Let the guests know that if they don't give 5 stars, they are actually failing their host! And if all you really want to do, Airbnb, is have people indicate if it's awesome or not - then just do a ""pass"" or ""fail"" - keep it simple! I'm weary of reading beautiful beautiful reviews and then having my heart drop when I see the 4 stars - another fail, another hit to my record that I have to ""make up"" to make it back to superhost.  


In 600+ reviews, I've had 2 one stars. It's pretty obvious from the content of their reviews that these people were outliers and don't give an accurate representation of what my house is about. A recent guest told me she picked my place because of all the glowing reviews - and I said ""oh! Man, I recently lost my superhost status because of someone who rated me low. Thank you for saying that."" and she said ""Oh you mean that old salty dog? Yeah I saw his review. He obviously wasn't going to be happy about anything. Everything else glowed.""

**March 2019** I was very disappointed in \[guest\] and her boyfriend. Despite the fact that the house rule states that no smoking is allowed in the suite, they were smoking ""pot"" (according to the boyfriend) in the suite until I confronted them! Although they left the inside of the suite relatively clean, the outside of the suite was littered with cigarette stubs and they checked out almost one and a half hours late (without prior agreement).

&#x200B;

**March 2019** Not a good experience. They helped themselves to drinks and bottled waters that belonged to myself, my roommate, and other guests, smoked in the room, checked out an hour and a half late, and took the key to the bedroom with them when they left. No response when I asked for the key back. Very disrespectful, and I would not host them again.

&#x200B;

The guests check in for a two week stay.

They said the toilet doesn't flush and that the refrigerator is ""leaking"".  Then they say that they want a full refund (basically have a free stay) or they will leave us a bad review.  It is the exact same scam from the exact same age group every year.  I guess they must spread this crap through Facebook or something. 
 Unfortunately for them, we have a maintenance guy on-site who was at the door within two hours.  They had shoved paper in the toilet until it clogged (unclogged in two seconds with the provided plunger) and they had set the fridge to maximum cold and adjusted the cheese drawer so that the door wouldn't close to a seal (thus causing condensation).

The messed up thing here is that even though we contacted Airbnb with documentation and photographic proof, they are still allowing these scam artists to leave a review (possibly costing us our super host status).  What is the point of leaving guests a scathing review if other hosts are penalized for rejecting them?

adad1f8c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,What I learned from staying in 14 airbnbs in 7 weeks,"My partner and I are just wrapping up an adventure-of-a-lifetime road trip around the United States. In total, the trip was 50 days long, with 30 of those spent in Airbnbs. I’ve noticed several trends throughout the trip that I thought would be useful or at least interesting for the people of /r/airbnb. So without any further ado:


1. Be honest about your kitchen. I’m sure plenty of people rarely, if ever, cook while traveling, but for a trip this long, we did a lot of our own cooking to save money. Every airbnb we booked listed having a “kitchen”. This ranged from well stocked with several pots and pans and all the appliances we could need, to mini fridge, sink, and hot plate with an 8 inch pan. The latter is NOT a kitchen. I realize it’s desirable to list a kitchen in your place, but try cooking a meal or two in your kitchen. A frozen pizza, a simple stir fry, or spaghetti and meatballs. You’ll realize you’re likely missing some things (potholders, a wooden spoon, a reasonably sized pot for boiling pasta, etc.). We traveled with a pot and pan of our own and more spices than most people probably have in their kitchens because we like to cook, so we were able to make do with what we had, but having a decently stocked kitchen will massively improve guests’ experiences.

2. Have clear check in instructions. It’s very nerve wracking to walk up on a porch and start poking around for a lockbox when you aren’t quite sure if you’re at the right place. Sending a map or a picture of the front door is helpful. Signs with arrows that say “Airbnb” or the guest’s name are incredibly helpful. Check in instructions like “Park under the large pine tree in the driveway, follow the stone path to the left of the house to the back, go through the gate and down the stairs, and you’ll find a lockbox with code 1234 that gets you into your room” accompanied by a sign or two make check in so much easier than “the key is in a lockbox in the foyer”.

3. Related- parking. Parking generally hasn’t been bad, but it’s helpful to note if the parking situation is a bit odd, e.g. being unable to park on the street without a permit.

4. Please have tissues in your airbnb. Many of the places we’ve stayed didn’t have tissues anywhere, and as someone who wakes up with a slightly stuffy nose every morning, they’re much appreciated.

5. Every airbnb so far has had half size paper towels. This isn’t a pro or con, just an observation. 

6. Recycling! Only a couple of the places we’ve stayed have had recycling bins. I hate throwing out obviously recyclable things but also can’t be dragging them around with me until I find a bin. Make sure there’s somewhere marked for recyclables, along with a list of what is and isn’t recyclable. 

7. Clean your stove! Almost every airbnb stove we’ve used on this trip has something burnt onto it that smelled when we turned a burner on. I don’t feel comfortable doing the minor disassembling needed to properly clean it, nor should I need to, but cooking in a kitchen that smells like something is burning is unpleasant and a bit annoying. 

That's all I can think of for now. Most of our airbnb's have been wonderful and I'm sure several of these things just aren't as obvious when it comes to airbnb cleaning/prep and get overlooked. Since they have come up again and again on our trip, I thought it would be helpful to share my experiences. 


ETA: It just crossed my mind that several airbnbs have had air fresheners, which I don't mind, but I do know these can trigger migraines in some people (e.g. my mom), so they may not be the best idea.

adad2112-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"My reservation starts tomorrow. The host just told me ""electricity is not included"".","Is this legal? The host tells me a day before my booking starts that:

> Sir, this room rate does not include electricity, and the electricity fee is paid separately.

Now I'm wishing I never booked this room. This looks like a major red flag.

I've never seen such a thing. *Can she do this?*

...and if she can't -- any advice on what to do next?

**UPDATE:** The host just wrote me back saying that I will need to ""cancel my reservation"". Of course since it starts tomorrow, that means she keeps the payment.  Any advice? This is starting to look like a scam.

**UPDATE 2:** I had multiple support chats with Airbnb. They repeatedly asked me if *I* wanted to cancel. I was very clear that cancellation carried a penalty for the full amount, and I did *not* want to cancel -- but if the host needed to cancel, then that was her decision. 

(For the record, Airbnb was less than reassuring at this point, and said they would ""See if they could get me a refund"".  ""See""? Again, I've done nothing wrong here). 

In response, the host refused to cancel but (rather unbelievably) insisted that I could stay there but she would shut off the electricity. (Clearly, she did not want to cancel either as she would then suffer the consequences). 

At which point, Airbnb stepped in and agreed to pay her $150 for the electricity. (Nice. Thanks Airbnb).

While I'm extremely thankful to Airbnb, I frankly don't think they should have had to do that at all. This host clearly omitted important information from the listing, and hit me with it at the last possible minute. This is a fundamentally dishonest practice. 

**UPDATE 3:** You thought it was over? After the problem had been resolved by Airbnb, the host sent me another email (in Mandarin, btw, not Khmer or English -- which she speaks perfectly), saying that if I go over the $150 in electricity budget, *she will shut off the electricity*.

adad2766-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Family finds hidden camera livestreaming from their AirBnB in Ireland,"[News article](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/05/europe/ireland-airbnb-hidden-camera-scli-intl/index.html)

After arriving at their Airbnb in Cork, Ireland, a family from New Zealand made an unsettling discovery: a hidden camera, livestreaming from the living room.

Nealie and Andrew Barker, from Auckland, were in the midst of a 14-month trip around Europe when they arrived at the Airbnb property with their four children and niece.
Once the family had unpacked, Andrew Barker, who works in IT security, scanned the house's Wi-Fi network.
The scan unearthed a camera, and subsequently a live feed. From the angle of the video, the family tracked down the camera, concealed in what appeared to be a smoke alarm or carbon monoxide detector.

""It was such a shock. It was just a really horrible feeling,"" Nealie Barker told CNN.
She called Airbnb to report the camera. ""They had no advice for us over the phone,"" she said. ""The girl just said that if you cancel within 14 days, you won't get your money back.""
Next, Andrew Barker called the owner of the property. When confronted with the family's discovery, Nealie Barker said, the host hung up. Later, he called back, insisting the camera in the living room was the only one in the house.
""We didn't feel relieved by that,"" she said, adding that the host refused to confirm whether he was recording the livestream, or capturing audio.
The family relocated to a nearby hotel and called Airbnb the following day. ""They still didn't seem to grasp the seriousness of the issue. They were treating it like a canceled booking,"" Nealie Barker said. Ultimately, Airbnb's trust and safety team promised to conduct an investigation, and it temporarily suspended the listing.

According to Nealie Barker, Airbnb did not contact the family again. After she got through to them two weeks later, the company told her that the host had been ""exonerated,"" and the listing reinstated.
It was only after she posted about the incident on Facebook and local New Zealand news stations reported her experience that the host was permanently banned, she said.


In a statement, Airbnb told CNN: ""The safety and privacy of our community -- both online and offline -- is our priority. Airbnb policies strictly prohibit hidden cameras in listings and we take reports of any violations extremely seriously. We have permanently removed this bad actor from our platform.""
""Our original handling of this incident did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves, and we have apologized to the family and fully refunded their stay. There have been over half a billion guest arrivals in Airbnb listings to date and negative incidents are incredibly rare.""
Aoife Mullen, communications manager for Ireland's Data Protection Commission, told CNN that the commission was ""aware of the issue,"" adding, ""we will be seeking further information from Airbnb on the matter.""

The Barker family is currently in Budapest, where, Nealie Barker said, ""We're staying in an Airbnb right now.""
""We've become much more cautious now,"" she said, advising other travelers to learn how to scan networks for hidden cameras. ""We think people need to realize that the travel market is largely unregulated and if you would take issue with being filmed, then you need to take all steps properly.""",0.95,85,1554468394.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/b9qrpu/family_finds_hidden_camera_livestreaming_from/,True,49

The four guests I mentioned were checking in today in a post in my previous thread have just cancelled their booking. I wasn't suspicious that this lot were connected with the previous three suspect guests, but now I am.

These guests have used Airbnb before, although this is the first time the person who booked my place has booked through Airbnb herself.

According to the story they told me, they found out the difference between an entire home and a private room last year when they booked another host's private room and cancelled when they found out he was living there. They reported him to Airbnb, who explained the difference between entire home and private room to them.

When they booked my place, they knew they were booking a private room. When I sent them a message letting them know that they had booked a private room and not an entire home, they knew that they weren't going to have the place to themselves.

They decided they wanted to cancel shortly after check in because they weren't getting an entire home, despite knowing they had booked a private room and were not expecting to have the home to themselves.

I'm really struggling to understand exactly what they were expecting.

They asked if they could get a full refund. I kindly offered to refund her for the nights I was able to get rebooked. The guests then left.

Later I received a text asking how much they would get back.

I told her that I didn't know at this point as nobody has rebooked the dates yet and told her that she would have to cancel her reservation before somebody was able to book.

The guest then tried blackmailing me, telling me that she would report me to Airbnb if I didn't cancel the booking myself. Obviously that threat is completely meaningless, but the fact that she tried blackmailing me means that she will no longer be getting any kind of refund if the dates get rebooked.
_________________
Update:

It turns out this four night booking is connected to the previous suspect bookings. I just had a request for money from the guest. Their first line was 'The host shouldn't change the room type from private room to shared room after I book.'. That was then followed up with a bunch of lies about the listing.

The guest is even trying to make the same claim as last week's guest that there's no bathroom here...

I'm surprised they booked for four nights when they only had to book for one. My guess is they tried to prevent me from getting four dates booked by actual guests and thought they would get a refund for the nights they didn't stay.

May 7th: As I do all new AirBNB guests (new to the platform), I send her a message explaining what to expect from a private room in a shared home (even though it states 11 times in my listing that it is a private room in a shared home)

May 8th: She sends this message saying, “Hello so I’m wondering is this a private home, personal home”

May 10th: The day before checkin, she sends this message, “I’m getting excited again and it seem like the weather may have some sunshine tomorrow so I just needed everything to go good I really do only there for 24 hours so I need this to be everything I hoped it would be”    


May 11th: Guest arrives and I walk them around the house, show them how to get to the beach, where the beach towels, chairs, umbrellas and everything else is. She actually arrived a couple hours before checkin time, so they were here about noon.

May 23rd: I get the following from AirBNB Support, “Hello Dan this is Ni-Kayla with Airbnb, and I am reaching out to you because the guest who stayed at your listing reached out to me here is the reservation code 8675309.
Dan that guest is asking if you willing to give her a full refund or at least some of the money back for her not staying at the listing due to her being uncomfortable.  She said her and her daughter was only there for a few hours before she packed and went and booked a hotel, and she felt like the listing didn't look how it looked on Airbnb website and she said the living room was flooded.”

The iot button is $20 bucks vs. $5 or less for the Amazon Dash version, but it's much more customizable.

Configuring the button is easy with the AWS IoT button smartphone app (easier then doing it from the computer interestingly.).  There are pre-made templates for ""text me when the button is pushed"".  You can find lots of people with more complex templates online.  We have it set up to text us when someone pushes it with the message ""The guests checked out.""

adad3c42-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Owner left bad review - went through the trash?!,"So I just got back from a 1 night stay at a Air bnb in a town 1.5 hours away. I booked the house two months in advance for a bachelorette party. I asked the owner if if was okay that we had a bachelorette party PRIOR to booking the house since he had a no events rule. He said that was fine as long as we didn’t have strippers and we conducted ourselves in a civilized manner...this was a group of 6 including the bride and the brides Mom and two of her older aunts. Not a roudy group by any means. We got dinner, did an art class and back to the house to play cards against humanity and typical bachelorette party games (pin the penis on the guy). We also had penis straws to drink from. Everyone was in bed by 1am and checked out by 8am. The house was left in the condition we arrived in, out the trash all away and tied it up. 

The host left me a horrible review saying that I was a pervert and we did obscene things in his house!!! He went through the trash and saw penis party decor. I should also mention that this guy was super religious and quoted the Bible when I arrived, but otherwise seemed nice.   I’ve called air bnb and asked for the review to be removed but I am appalled at the review and his messages to me. He started going on about we forced the bride to do pornographic things and we are ruining the marriage etc. what are my option here???

adad40fc-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,I just got my first bad review...,"...and I'm pissed! Not because I can't handle negative feedback, but because these people were difficult from the moment they booked 1 month ago. It was two Chinese people (not the issue, just stating for context. I host foreign people all the time and never have problems). Previously I made a post on here about the difficulty dealing with them because of what i thought was a language barrier. That was only part of it....they flat out did not 'get' the concept of airbnb. First thing, they booked three nights and wanted 9. They couldn't have 9 because another girl had alread booked the room for two weeks following their 3rd day. It took me using google translate, a screenshot of my calendar, and a representative from airbnb to get them to understand they had to leave after the 3rd day. Then, flashforward serveral weeks. They start telling me they wanted to check in at noon. Not possible. Chechin clearly says 4pm. Checkout is noon, I had a guest in there, I don't get off of work until 1:30 and use 2-4pm preparing the room. Again, google translate, pics of THEIR checkin details showing 4, and a representative from airbnb that speaks chinese stepping in. Finally they agreed to 2pm instead of noon (yea, I know). They get here, seem VERY unhappy with the room and parking, and all my ammenities. Like they didn't read ANY of my posting or look at a single one of my VERY clear pictures of what everything looks like. I even have pictures of the parking space. They messaged me several times throughout the evening asking for stuff. I went up 4 times between checkin and 10:30pm (It's a top level duplex with multiple rooms and common areas). 

You see, I read all the time here people complaining about guests not understanding its not a hotel. But my wife and I run this place LIKE a hotel. We clean top to bottom every Friday and after every guest checks out, plus spot clean every 2 days while we're here. Its just how we like to run it, and it pays off because every guest has been happy. These people wanted a new blanket, internet password (again in the checkin details), TV which is NOT listed in the posting. There is a TV in the common area with PS4, games, Netflix, PlutoTV, etc....but they wanted cable. We provide a washingmachine, dryer, laundry soap, fabric softener, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, cookware, salt, pepper, ketchip, mustard, etc......but when they left they wrote in my review that the facilities were outdated, the building was too old, and that parking was on a grassy slope. NOT true, it is a 6 car gravel driveway and there is grass along the edge that comes through some of the gravel. No slope at all! Also, this is a newly renovated property. I mean like, renovations just finished in April. New dryway, piping, electrical, etc....the only thing that MIGHT be considered outdated is the stove, because it wasnt brand new when it was put in but is less than 10 years old. 

They stayed less than 24 hours, left the next day, rode out the other 3 days of their booking and left me a 3 star review complaining about things that they either should have seen the day they booked the place or were blantantly making up. It's not fair, because they got the room priced for 3 days what most in the area price for 2 days and hotels price for 1 day. It burns me up the most because I had airbnb support helping me with them for weeks leading up til their stay and they weren't even here a full day. The guest in the room before them stayed 27 days and wrote me the best review I have received so far. Another guy who is up their right now couldn't believe how entitled they were. He was staying in the other room and barely got to see them. He has no complaints at all and has been their 4 days with 13 more to go. That's another thing, they were upset that it had shared space with other guests, IT SAYS ALL THAT IN THE DESCRIPTION AND SHOWS PICTURES OF WHATS PRIVATE AND WHAT""S SHARED!!!

adad4278-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Unpopular opinion: Guest ratings are meaningless as long as hosts are forced to accept most/all requests.,"What good does a shitty review of problematic guests do for hosts when the platform is pushing hard for everyone to use instant book, and hosts are punished for not accepting ~90% of reservation requests? 

Guests with some bad reviews can still use instant book (regardless of what airbnb says it does to restrict use of instant book or offer settings to only allow positive-reviewed guests to book, you can see accounts of this happening online). 

Guests with bad reviews can still try to book with anyone without instant book, and airbnb just threatens the host with potential deactivation for saying no, if the host's % of accepted bookings isn't high enough.

Thoughts? I have been told that even listed reasons for declining that are the GUEST'S fault (asking for wrong dates, making illegal requests, making host uncomfortable) will count against the host's acceptance %, which is functionally antithetical to the notion that reviews of guests are for the host communities benefit...

Airbnb doesn't want us to look at the reviews and steer clear of problem guests. They want us to accept the booking and take our own measures to prevent the guests from destroying our homest. the reviews are just there for us to blow of steam and feel like we did something to get back at a bad host after the fact.

&#x200B;

The host told me before booking that he would stay the first 4 days (July 4-8th), and I agreed with that.

&#x200B;

The first thing I noticed after check-in was a cat that was not listed on the description, I'm not allergic but I don't want to be taking care of an animal that's not mine. 

Plus I don't like cats.

So, he actually leaves the house on the night of 8 of July, but leaves the cat here, and also sent his cousin to stay here from July 9 to 13 (!!?!?!). 

He told me this after booking, through WhatsApp.

&#x200B;

After the cousin leaves, we thought we finally could be alone, but the host returned the 17 of July claiming that was just for the weekend and would leave on July 21, and he actually leaves that day, but his partner/husband stays until July 23.

&#x200B;

From July 23 to today, July 29 the house was for ourself but he jus and he just texts me that he is going to be at home again tonight...

&#x200B;

Plus, I had to feed the frecking cat, and it made poop on the floor twice, I called a friend who loves cat to clean it up before I kill the mother f\*cker.

I'm sorry for the bad words, at the moment I'm just mad as hell, this f\*king moron could have told me that he didn't want to rent the entire place and that was a cat so I would look for another place.  


Lesson learned, ask before booking if they had any kind of animals that I had to take care of, even if it sounds oddly specific.

adad494e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guest found a loop hole in Airbnb's minimum stay settings. Now Airbnb expects me to break the local laws.,"My Airbnb is based in Berlin. Short term rentals here are forbidden by law and carry a fine of up to 100 000€. In order to comply with the law, I've set the minimum stay to 80 days and have a strict cancellation period. 

&#x200B;

I've been an Airbnb host for many years and this worked fine until now: I had a guest book my apartment for over 100 days. Great. 

Three days before check in, I get a message from Airbnb that the booking dates have been changed to 28 days. I had no say in it. This is obviously below my 80 day minimum and in direct violation of the local law. 

I called up Airbnb and it has been a shit show since: The first customer rep. made a lot of mistakes, like telling me the full name of the guest without verifying me. Only a few minutes later, he remembered that he needs to verify me first. 

After 20 minutes, I finally got him to escalate my call to a case manager. My case manager kept patronizing me, telling me that I must have confirmed the change of dates and he just *knows for sure* that I did. After another 20 minutes, I had him look into the actual emails that were sent by Airbnb. The request of change was sent only a few seconds before the confirmation, so he eventually started changing his narrative to it being ""a grey area"" - whatever that was supposed to mean. I kept insisting and eventually he put me on hold and had to admit that there was a [recent change in Airbnb's rules.](https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies#long-term) Long term stays can be changed, even if there's a strict cancellation policy and the minimum stay length is ignored. **It's a neat loop hole to circumvent minimum stay settings.**

I said that I either want the guest to stay the entire time or have the guest cancel and pay the cancellation fee. Instead my case manager let the guest cancel, without any fees and I'm left with an empty apartment that I won't get rented out this shortly. This is a loss of a few hundred, if not even a few thousand Euros. And none of this was my fault in any way.

adad4c78-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Pet Peeve from a Guest - a bad shower head can ruin a stay,"You can ignore me if you like. I’m a 5-star perfect guest and likely wouldn’t dock a host stars for a bad shower head, but some might. A bad shower can ruin an otherwise nice stay.

Here’s the suggestions...

Make sure your hot water heater works. Continuous ones that run hot and cold need servicing. Tanks that are too small, warn the guests to keep showers short. (Mind you, I’m a 10-minute type of showerer... not anything crazy). 

**Get a decent showerhead.** I’m always surprised when apartments/houses have bad water pressure *and* a lousy showerhead. You can get a decent one from Home Depot, less than $50 usually, that has multiple settings that will mimic better pressure. I have a WaterPic one in my own home. It’s the type that you can also hold, is magnetic, and has multiple setting, two of which force the water out stronger and make weak pressure feel like stronger pressure. This is good for getting soap out of your hair. 

And it goes without saying... make sure the shower is clean, including the shower head. Shower heads can collect mineral deposits and mildew and get pretty gross over time if you or your cleaning crew doesn’t attend to them properly. Replace and wash your shower curtains, clean the shower properly, and clean the shower head too!

I stay in AirBNBs a lot traveling for work... and I hate a poor shower. It’s so easy to fix usually... or at least make a lot better, with just a little effort.

adad4e30-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Note to AirBNB Management from a Superhost,"I'm a host with a 4.9/5.0 rating from over 250 guests. I bend over backwards for my guests and it shows because I've been a superhost since the beginning of the program. This policy of issuing threatening letters to host who cancels a reservation, a SINGLE reservation, is utterly pathetic. I cancelled an instant booking within 10 minutes of it being made and it was 7 days of checkin, plenty of time for the guest to rebook. The circumstances were unavoidable, (I'm in a clinical trial for a new drug and organizers needed me to come in unexpectedly because of a scheduling issue). An AirBNB host makes their home available, we basically bring a guest into our lives with all the variables,  unplanned and uncontrollable, a typical human has. Here's a partial list, births, deaths, sickness (kids, parents, spouses), unexpected car issues, unexpected local tragedies, weather issues, unexpected work assignment, family friend needs assistance for all the above, building issues which need immediate repair, clinical trials... Basically, I understand that cancellations are bad for the business but we are not sterile corporate hotels, we are humans and that is one of the reasons AirBNB is successful; our guests are looking for a human experience. Unfortunately, the other side of the coin is that cancellations will happen and a threatening letter won't make a goddam bit of difference. In fact it is counter productive because it is only going to piss the good hosts off and not make a bit of difference to a bad host. And before some other host says that ""oh you should have called AirBNB customer service"", let me respond to that to say I know that but it's the policy that is the issue and the attitude that one cancellation triggers the nastygrams.  In fact, when I cancel I should get the opposite email, the one that says "" Mr. Superhost, I see you cancelled a single reservation in x number of years, ARE YOU ALRIGHT? Please let us help!"" Besides the platform should handle all of this making a phone call unnecessary. So AirBNB, if I cancel again due to unforseen circumstances, fuck you, you are going to lose your status with me, I'm going to suspend you indefinitely because well, I really don't need you are your fucking mistreatment of your staff which basically all host are just that, staff.

Our checkout instructions are very simple:

- Turn off the heater (if you turned it on)
- Dont forget to leave the key

The guest checked out but didnt turn the heater off, so by the time we got there the heater had been on a long time. Given the room is only $40/night, it basically destroys all the profit.

We left the guest the following 5 star review, with just one star removed from the 'house rules' category (since the guest clearly didn't read or follow basically the only rule).

""Good guest, just didnt turn off the heater as per the check out instructions which is expensive for us'.

The guest left us a great 5 star review as we usually get.

When the guest saw our review of her, she turned feral and started messaging me telling me we should put a sticker on the heater if we want people to turn it off.

I replied saying that our check-out instructions were extremely simple, we didnt make any money from her stay due to the fact she didnt follow them, and that its common sense to turn the heater off anyway.

She didnt like that and said she would contact Airbnb.

She said she just appreciates that it didn’t cause any damage and hopes we will seriously reconsider our actions.

adad574a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,How to find AirBnB listings with EV charging,"Hi! I made a post asking if we can filter listings by EV Charging. https://np.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/bbduly/ev_charging_and_airbnb/

I figured out a hacky way of doing it. Currently the EV Charger amenity is given a value of `97` on airbnb. These values are what airbnb uses to filter listings.

If you want to filter based on this, all you have to do is go search an area and add any filter you want. I'll search in Philadelphia and add a heating filter:

https://www.airbnb.com/s/Philadelphia--PA--United-States/homes?refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&query=Philadelphia%2C%20PA%2C%20United%20States&place_id=ChIJ60u11Ni3xokRwVg-jNgU9Yk&search_type=UNKNOWN&amenities%5B%5D=30&map_toggle=true&allow_override%5B%5D=&s_tag=u3g2mh35

adad58d0-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Rant: 88% requirement is a joke,"Superhost here. I have a condo located in a very-popular tourist destination, listed with a very-reasonable pricing as I'm trying to accommodate a diversity of people. During the last month, I had to decline 6 requests: 

- I have not only one, not 2 but 3 dogs!! 
- I'm renting your apartment but it's my friend who's going to be staying there. I don't have his ID because it's my friend.
- We're a group of 6-7 although it says your max is 5. 
- Thank you for the info..I forgot to mention that we don't wanna use our credit cards because of BS reasons so we're thinking of paying cash. 
- Does your building have a key-elevator, i'm working and I will have several ""co-workers"" coming in and out. Do they have to sign-in with the doorman? 
- I can't wait to meet you :) :) XOXOXOXOX :) :) :) :) Oh you're not giving me the keys. That's a shame :( 

Why am I being penalized for this? It's absurd! It even goes against safety: personal and financial.

adad5d44-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,The reality of hosting on air BnB.,"We have hosted over 550 guests. We have had a 90%+ occupancy rate and achieved superhost (more than 80% of reviews 5 stars which is the highest you can get)

Most people you host on air BnB will be really nice and it can be a pleasure to meet new people from all over the world. 

However, when shit hits the fan which it will inevitably do at some point you think air BnB will protect you with their host protection.... haha, not so fast!

Air BnB are good at strategically responding to issues that hit the media, but won't do a damn thing for the common folk and the issues they're likely to encounter eventually.

We've hosted over 550 guests, with 5 of those being really bad. So about a 1% bad guest rate, and it seems the law of averages caught up with us in the space of two weeks.

A few examples of bad guests we have experienced:

1. Old couple with 9 good reviews booked.

Spent the night drinking and chain smoking in our room. I knocked on the door and asked if they were smoking, the response ""no, outside"".

It's bullshit, they know it, I know it, but how do you prove they're smoking without seeing them do it?

I called air BnB and asked them to remove them from our house, they insisted they stay the night and I could claim a cleaning fee from them by raising a dispute.

Raised dispute, guest refused, air BnB refused to pay anything. Air BnB just wanted to push the booking through at our expense.

2. A lady with 2 good reviews books. 

She is a drug fucked junkie. She was smoking inside our room and after what happened in incident 1) I didn't bother calling air BnB. I know they're as useless as tits on a bull. So we copped it sweet, lodged a dispute after she left which included photos of her ashes in the bin, on the chair, scattered throughout the room on the floor. She declined to pay any money. I spent 1 hour cleaning up after her and several days airing the room out while I transferred bookings to my other listing.

3. A lady books for 4 nights with 2 adults.

She turns up over 2 hours early before check in with a child. We don't accept children because we've had kids in the past which have tormented my rescue dog and children are just annoying when they're not your kids or relatives.

We are petty easy going, so we decided to go with it.. we went away for the first night to avoid her kid for my dog's sake.

Came home the second night and went to bed at 10pm, normal time. Woken up at 11:20pm by this lady and her child talking in really loud voices which was making my dogs bark and go crazy which they never do.

I went out and asked her to keep it down because we were trying to sleep as it's Sunday night and we have work the next day.

They continued on for 20mins so I went out again and found the front door wide open with the screen door open and her kid running around on the verandah yelling at the top of his lungs. Probably woke my neighbours up as well.

I turned off the lights, shut the door and told them to go to bed. I then called air BnB and explained the situation, asked them to remove them in the morning (I'm not so heartless as to kick a mum and her child out at midnight with nowhere to go).

Air BnB also wanted proof from me there was a child, I.e. I had to take a photo. Second time I have ever called up about a booking after hosting over 500 guests and they don't believe me. Ridiculous.

I called air BnB again at 6am and 7am to remove the guest after being told they would call her (through their Chinese office as her English was not very good. Nothing. So at 8am I kicked her out myself.

4. One girl with good reviews books and she is  extremely needy and thinks we have nothing better to do than wait on her hand and foot all day for $50

She messaged us about no less than 10 different things, here's what I can remember:

- her flight arrives 8:30pm, car rental closes at 8pm, what can she do (not my problem)
- for our address (in the reservation details)
- how to get to our place (fair enough, but she asked after she landed and we thought she was driving after her message about car rental)
- messaged us saying the taxi driver is asking for $25 (yeah... so?)
- asking where the hair dryer is at 11:30pm, she then proceeds to use it when other people are sleeping 
- asking if we can take her to the airport in the morning to pick up her hire car
- what time are we leaving for work 

She paid $50 for a room in Sydney near the airport/station with fresh sheets, that is damn cheap by anyone's standards.



Then there is all the usual bullshit of guests thinking they are special snowflakes - wanting to check in early, check out late - both are nearly impossible considering I don't have 100 rooms like a hotel. If that's not possible, they want to leave their luggage or come and pick it up - doing so would require me to be home when they come so I can't do things like walk my dogs or go to the gym. I flat out say no and even have it in my listing don't ask, but everyone thinks they are special.

Now here is the kicker. I called air BnB and said we can no longer host because my mum is undergoing chemo and we don't have the time to commit to hosting anymore. Air BnB demanded proof otherwise penalties will apply and my account might be banned.

Go fuck yourself, air BnB.

adad5eb6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,am I being scammed?,"A 2 night guest (whole house rental, I live there when it's not rented) went though my belongings and found an unplugged, inactive disconnected camera in a box.  In a drawer in my storage room.

They claim that I have to list all security cameras; it wasn't a security camera. It was in my formerly locked storage room with my personal items.

The next night they claimed the roof is leaking like a waterfall and the kitchen is full of ants.

The roof is not leaking and there are no ants.

They want us to Venmo 1/2 of the stay.

I have a feeling they will go to airBnB about the camera in my personal items.  I'm a photographer.   The  body of a Nikon D70 without battery, lens, or memory card is just a $150 paperweight in storage....

adad6032-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,I’m staying at my first airbnb for my practicum placement- amazing experience,"So, a little background. My program doesn’t offer paid practicum, and we cant stay on site regardless of where you end up being placed. This means we need to find places to stay. I dont know anyone in the city Ive been placed (about 5 hours away from home), and as a result had to go the airbnb route. Its amazing, the whole basement to this couples home, and a few free pets of their sweet old dog on my way out and in.

Since money is a little tight my parents (bless them) helped me out with some groceries, and veg from their garden. I rationed all they gave me to make sure I dont have to do a trip to the store before my time here is up. Plan successful, I had a bit of food each day, just enough for gas home, and rent on the 31st.

Just now, the woman upstairs knocked on my door and asked if I wanted a package of chicken wings- if I could take the heat. I thanked her profusely, and she went on to ask if I wanted a cucumber or two from her garden. To this I said “no, thank you! I have some cucumbers!”, but she insisted as “I know how it is! We have daughters in school!” Brought me upstairs, and filled a bag with cucumbers, zucchini, cabbage, and carrots.

I recognize how lucky I am to not have had faced this in school as of yet, I always made it work. This was the first time Ive needed to be careful with how much food I eat/buy. 

I am blown away by this act of generosity, I had to share. Bless Violeta! As soon as I can, Ill be paying this forward.",0.96,73,1566691986.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/cv19at/im_staying_at_my_first_airbnb_for_my_practicum/,True,4
adad61ae-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,My mom's guests destroyed her house in a hateful way -,"My mom rented out the entire house for a group of people that were going to throw a party. This is the first - and definitely last - time she hosted a party group. Although the entire house was rented, there were areas that were off limits she had locked up, including a couple of closets and the garage. 

&#x200B;

The damages:

&#x200B;

Lots of small things in the common areas were damaged, and it was evident people had been smoking in the house given the rolling papers etc. they left in the house. There was also vomit all over the shower and bathroom walls, urine all over the sheets. A table and patio chair were broken outside, the refrigerator door was dented as it had been kicked, etc. I think things like this are to be expected after hosting a party, but they were the least of the damages.

&#x200B;

The renters got into pretty much every off-limits room (all of which were locked), including my mom's bedroom closet. They proceeded to open up and use three drones my mom bought recently for my cousins. They took towels out of the locked closets and left them all over the house. Luckily we switched the deadbolt on the garage so it could only be unlocked from inside the garage, and that was the ONLY off-limits room they didn't get into. (You can see face prints on the windows of the door - they definitely tried)

&#x200B;

My mom has a policy for renters that they had to be over a certain age to stay at the house for the party. This was made clear and reciprocated by the renters. However, when the renters were breaking into the rooms, it was evident they had a small child / children in the house, because they got into my sister's art supplies and drew all over the comforter, and some of the side railing along the stairway. There was also a child's drawing lying around.

&#x200B;

A nice towel had also been stolen from the house, but nothing else appears to be missing.

&#x200B;

My mom has some Christian symbols around the house, including a small (1 foot) cross hanging in her room. The reason I use ""hateful"" in the title is because the renter took one of my mom's crosses off the wall hanging in her room - and ejaculated on it - then hung it back up. I can understand a lot of the damages left around the house, especially after a party, but the fact they would do something like this feels... disgusting and personal.

&#x200B;

My mom has tried to contact the renter several times through Airbnb, but hasn't received any response - it seems like the renter intends to avoid the situation as much as possible (he has turned off his account). 

&#x200B;

In the end, we have lots of pictures with all the damages, which total up to \~$2200. As far as escalating this issue, we don't know what to expect with Airbnb compensating us, but my mom is new to this, and we are in need of advice. What action should we take to get compensation for the damages? We still have the cross - uncleaned - and don't know whether it would help our case... From reading some of the other posts in the sub, police reports seem like a good idea for stolen property, but in our case only a towel was stolen. Should we still file a report? Should we include damaged property / trespassing (probably a long shot)? And do you have general advice for handling this through Airbnb? My mom has contacted Airbnb, but won't hear back for a bit because there is a 72-hour period Airbnb waits to get a response from the renter. It still hasn't been 72 hours, but because the guest turned off their account, we're pretty sure we won't hear anything back from them before then.

&#x200B;

TLDR - My mom hosted a party through Airbnb for the first time - guests damaged furniture, forced entry into off-limits areas at EVERY possible opportunity and raided most of our personal items, had small children against policy defacing property, and a guest ejaculated on my mom's cross hanging in her room and replaced it on the wall.

Last night at about one in the morning I was awoken to what I thought was thunder. Instead, my guest had explosive diarrhea. There were three doors and a hallway between me and the noise but it was that loud. About 15 minutes later I was hit with the smell. This amazed me as, cause once again, three doors and a hallway. It must have been stifling in the bathroom. This went on all night. He must have been packing his colon like a hamster pouch for weeks. I did not get up or check to see if he was dead as I could hear he wasn't dead even though it smelled like he was.   


This morning, as soon as he heard me up, he staggered out and ask if I could go to the store and get him meds. I pointed out that when he checked in I showed him the ""sick bucket"" that has imodium, Pepto, Gatorade, crackers, band-aids, mosquito repellent, aloe for sunburns, cough syrup, chicken soup, Tylenol...... I knew he wasn't paying attention to me when he checked in. PLUS, I have the whole list of what is in there and where it is in my house manual.  Don't feel too sorry for him. Feel sorry for my housekeeper cuz it sounds like the bathroom has been frosted with feces like it was a birthday cake.   


My first instance of having a guest that didn't feel well was my second ever guest I had in Houston. Uber dropped off a guy who was doubled over. He told me he had kidney stones and was in a ton of pain and just needed to go straight to his room to lay down. At eleven that night, he texted me from his bedroom asking where the closest emergency room was. I felt I needed help so I took him to the best emergency care facility I knew of. They took him back and I sat in the waiting room for about 40 minutes. Then the nurse came and got me and said, ""your friend wants you to come on back."" Friend??? I had spent less than a half hour with him face to face. I went back and sure enough he said he was so glad I was there because he had a fear of hospitals. Have you ever sat with a stranger while they were trying to pass kidney stones that had been ultrasonically broken up?  Awkward but a very bonding experience. I got a great review but none of it mentioned our time spent discussing whether his gown was totally closed in back on his trips to the bathroom.

adad75d6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guests you've turned down. What were your reasons? I have a few..,"Examples of shit I've turned down..

Movies: Yep, for some reason I've had 4 requests to film a movie in my AirBnb. Each time they were very upfront about the filming, how I would receive credit, etc. So, credit in your porn flick? Each time I declined by saying we do not allow commercial filming on the property.. Not worth it.

Children: No joke. I've had Juniors in high school send me booking inquiries. How they want to see the big city for themselves without their parents.. No f-ing way is it worth it.

Extra Guests: The inquiries go like this.. Hi, I'm wanting to stay at your place with my 3 friends but on such and such night we want to invite some other friends over but they won't stay the whole trip.. Hell no! You're just going to pack people in like sardines.

Frat boys: Hey, is it alright if I pay you when I get there? Me and a friend are starting new jobs for the summer and we need a place to stay for a few months. Is there enough room for our ""stuff"".. Nope. NO room Brah.

Crazies: I want to know what the commute to ""place like 1hr away"" is like as I'm starting a new job. And is there enough room for storage of 3 cardboard boxes with fruit and food? Can I bring personal items to decorate for my stay?.. Yeah, no.. 

Scary: Two bearded men arrive. Freak out over cameras on driveway and walkway (there to defend against porch pirates) and want to leave. Demand I remove any images of them. Uh no, Definitely not. Then decide that a random locked door in apartment leads to another living space and it invades their privacy. I show them that the door leads to a storage space. They still freak out and leave.. Uh, FBI, I may have a lead for you..

Dirty Thieving Guests: They got me once, but not again. Couple stays, stains up the place, steals blankets. Two weeks later inquire about staying again so I ask, if I say yes are you going to bring my blankets back?.. Crickets

Hookers: No shit. I got burned twice but their MO is always the same. They live in the city about 20 minutes away and want to book the place for a romantic weekend. They arrive early alone, ""boyfriend"" No 1 arrives in the evening. Next day Boyfriend No 2 arrives, and so on. And they won't leave a review of course.. John, keep your trysts out of my house as the last thing I need is your deranged wife following you here and causing a scene. 

Hackers: I need access to your router. Well, there's the wifi username and password. That's only the guest account.. Yeah, and that's all your getting, l33t h@x0r.

Special Needs: How wide is your toilet? Can it support 500lbs? Well, I don't know if it can as I didn't buy a heavy duty or special toilet, best we don't test it.. Sorry, good luck in your search. 

Super Private: Is it possible that for our stay nobody else is in the home? Well, nobody is going to be in your apartment but you. No, I mean in the entire home. Hmm, so you don't want anyone hearing you saw that body up?.. Oh, hell no.. Who even asks this shit?!

The worst kind, they stayed: They didn't read a fucking thing about the apartment, never bothered to check the location. Everything goes OK and then they crap on your review for the location. Asses, the ad states exactly where the home is. Don't take it out on me because you're stupid! I had one twit ask where the swimming area was, this was just 3 weeks ago in the North East, and got mad at me when I explained it's frozen over. But that's not what the picture shows! How have you made it this far in life? How is it that you haven't followed your GPS off a bridge trying to get here?! Why me?!

The list goes on and on.. It's still great fun though.

adad7766-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,PSA: Do not sign contracts outside of the platform,"After years of hosting and traveling on Airbnb and more and more management companies using the platform, I am finding this to be more common and ridiculously aggravating.  You are only hurting yourself if you agree to additional terms after booking.  To be clear: if the host did not disclose an additional required contract in full BEFORE you booked, they cannot ask you to sign anything else, electronically or in person as part of the agreement.  3 times in the last year I've dealt with this.

In Orlando: booked a condo and the management company immediately cut and pasted a bunch of terms and conditions into our chat and sent me some electronic forms to sign.  The cut and pasting was the most ridiculous thing.  I responded with ""you understand this isn't legally binding right?"" and refused the electronic forms.  I was clear that they were welcome to cancel my reservation if this was a deal breaker for them, but that our contract was on Airbnb and only Airbnb.  I also told them they needed to update their listing to disclose the contract in advance.  They didn't. My review reflected.  

In Clearwater: booked a condo, got electronic documents.  Refused again.  Same communications.  When their condo didn't meet the terms of the listing they said ""well it was disclosed in the additional contracts,"" that's your problem, not mine.  They also did not revise their listing.  Again reflected in my review.

In Costa Rica: booked a condo.  When I got there to pick up the keys, they present me with a written contract.  Hard no. Language barrier was really fun but their argument was ""you only have contract with Airbnb, this is with us."" I refused again, ""OUR contract is mediated by Airbnb.  We do not need another one and I will not agree to additional terms."" I was given the keys.  Advised them to update their listing.  You guessed it, they did not.  In the review.

These hosts all violated their contract with Airbnb and all said no one else has ever had a problem with it.  Please push back hard on this behavior because these management companies are ruining the platform.  I'm to the point where I just won't book with hosts who have multiple listings.  You will never be served by contracting, communicating or paying outside of Airbnb.  And if anything ever goes wrong and you have, you have no recourse.  Airbnb cannot and will not help you.

Edit to add, for those hosts who clearly haven't read their Terms of Service and believe they're entitled to this gross infraction of them, here's the authority on the matter:  https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/465/can-hosts-ask-guests-to-sign-a-contract",0.83,71,1568375431.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/d3o2ya/psa_do_not_sign_contracts_outside_of_the_platform/,True,89

A lot has happened this weekend! Friday, the day after I posted, I called my parents to talk to them about it (they’re funding this until I make money at my job and can pay them back). I basically broke down, had to pull over from driving and just screamed into my car because I had no privacy to do that where I was staying lol.

They wanted me to try talking to her one last time. So I texted her telling her we needed to talk, composed myself, and drove to her house. I brought up the fact that what she was doing wasn’t right and that she couldn’t enter my room willy nilly and touch my stuff. She immediately started arguing and said it was my fault for leaving my dirty clothes on the floor and that I disrespected her by doing that. I told her I’d report her and she told me she’d report me because I left my window open 5 times! 

(I left my window open twice out of the thirty days I had already stayed.....)

I got heated and just ran out. I tearfully called my parents and drove around the block. Once I calmed down I went in, packed everything I could, and got the hell out of dodge (Is that the phrase??). Anyways, because I’m 20 and not 21, I couldn’t check into a hotel for the weekend. That was kinda shitty because I didn’t find that out until 9 PM. To make a long story short, it was a shit night.

I was stressed, worried about where I’d sleep on Monday, and worried that *I* was in the wrong and not her. Well guess what!! Not only have I found a place to stay for half of what I was spending before, Airbnb refunded the rest of my stay!!!! I’m so happy, I’m going to save so much money and save myself from going crazy lmao. 

Airbnb was horrified at what she had done, and was so helpful with everything. I’ve gotten 90% of my money back. And my old host tried chasing my car down the road when we dropped off her key. Lol. I even took pictures of the house when I left for good so she couldn’t blame us for imaginary “damage”. I hope I can leave a bad review just to save anyone a heartache.

To be clear, when I booked the room she was a 5 star super host. Nothing in her profile indicated that she’d enter my room and touch my shit. Especially the fact that the listing had the word private in it more than once!!! 

Airbnb has been so good to me in the past and I will 100% use it in the future, this just goes to show that crazy people can be hiding in plain sight.

adad7be4-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Hosts Beware - Air Bnb sent me two bookings from guest accounts that had been hacked this weekend,"I am a host that had not one, but two fraudulent requests over this weekend. Both were last minute/day of bookings which will raise a red flag for me especially if the guest has no reviews and/or lives in the same city. That said often are just people looking to do road trip on a whim and these bookings are legit - not this time. The first booking had six great reviews and was from a town a few hours away so it made sense. Confirmed the booking, messaged them the keyless entry codes and went on with my day. I received a message about an hour and a half later that the reservation was cancelled. I Checked my email and it was the guest stating that her air bnb account was hacked, she didn't book this, and was presently half way around the world on vacation. That was very disconcerting as I had already given the codes for entry so I got over to the house as quickly as possible. Called Air Bnb about it while en route. CSR was very nice but clueless as to how to help. When I got to the house the front door was unlocked and opened but luckily no one was there, nothing taken or damaged. It seems they were hoping to have a party at the house later.  I deletled the code, locked up everything and felt lucky to have dodged a bullet.

Yesterday I got another last minute/day of booking. Middle Aged Woman from the east coast with multiple great 5 star reviews. Her original message to me was very similar to the last one ""Beautiful home, do you have the key codes to send me?""  This time I am leery and call Air Bnb to have them call the guest directly to verify that they have indeed booked this reservation. The CSR again was nice enough but really didn't grasp the situation. After explaining everything a couple of times he agrees to call guest and then will call me back. While waiting for the call back, the guest is contacting me through the app that she is leaving the airport and will be at the house in a half hour. I wait for Air Bnb to call back before responding. I get a call from Argentina, yup it's Air Bnb (what am I going to be charged for that call??). CSR says he spoke with the guest and it's legitimate. I tell him I am still very skeptical. He 100% assures me it is them and the booking is legit. I ask that he put that in writing and send me an email confirming that which he does. I respond to guest that I will meet them at the house to get them in when they arrive as I am only 5 minutes away - at this point no way am I giving access to home without meeting this person. I am not surprised at all when she replies she isn't there yet 'but her friend is, can you let them in?'  Uh no you made the booking, you have to be the person to check in.  'Well it took longer than I thought so I decided to go do some shopping, can you meet in an hour?'  Sure but I thought she was in an uber on the way from the airport? Five minutes later she cancelled despite the fact I have a strict cancel policy and she would be billed.

Couple very concerning things here. 1. There definitely seems to be some kind of breach here that Air Bnb has yet to disclose. 2. Customer Service doesn't seem to have any idea of what is going on or how to help

adad874c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Need advice on an awful AirBnB rental,"My husband and I rented an Airbnb this week to take my parents on vacation. We chose our house based on how quiet and relaxing it would be. We thought we found the perfect place for us to share a relaxing time and be able to fish right off the back porch. This was one of the reasons we chose the rental we got. 

When we checked in yesterday we noticed loud construction noise coming from the back area of the house.  Went outside and noticed they are repairing the seawall on the property of the rental. There was an air compressor right outside of the living room window that is extremely loud along with hammering/sawing and construction guys smoking less than 10 feet from the patio and windows, essentially occupying the entire back space that we have paid for to fish and hangout from for the next week.  

We contacted our host and asked if they knew what was going on with the construction and when it would stop. First, they lied and said they had no idea it was going on. We responded back that we highly doubted the property management would not inform them of construction going on on their property.  They sent back they knew it was going to happen in August but didn’t know when.  This was extremely frustrating to us.  We rented this particular house for the reason of using the back area space. We did not think we were going to be sharing it with loud construction noise and workers.  We explained to the host we were not happy and wanted to figure out a way to resolve the problem.  They wanted nothing to do with it. We then involved AirBnb. We sent them pictures of the construction and all the loose nails and screws that the workers so nicely left on the ground for us to step on. Airbnb was no help. 
Feeling very defeated we went to sleep last night not knowing what to do. We awoke this morning at 8am to the same air compressor and hammering we had to listen to all yesterday and a message from the hosts declining our request for a refund saying “if you think it’s that bad and you can’t take it, then leave our house and don’t stay there.”

If my husband and I could easily afford to find another place to stay we would.   But we spent months saving up to take my parents on this relaxing vacation. We don’t have the funds to just find another place for the week. This was supposed to be a trip to celebrate my moms last chemo treatment. We wanted to give her a quiet place where she could sit outside with her fishing pole enjoying life.  Instead we have construction noise and cigarette smoke. We don’t feel comfortable or safe for that matter sitting outside while this is going on. We are waiting for our case manager to get back to us, but Airbnb said they wouldn’t be available for another hour. Apparently the case manager that started your case has to see it through start to finish. Just wondering if anyone has dealt with anything like this before and how we should move forward?

UPDATE!  Airbnb went above and beyond by fully reimbursing the original amount of the full stay and gave us a $1000 credit towards finding a new place. Found a new place 7 minutes away and it’s perfect. 

Thanks for all the comments and suggestions, appreciate it.  We are looking forward to to spending the rest of our vacation stress and noise free.",0.95,72,1565706378.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/cptvcc/need_advice_on_an_awful_airbnb_rental/,True,43
adad88f0-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Be cautious if you are interested in being an Airbnb host.....,"I've had two terrible experiences in the past month as a host and I thought I would give people a heads up. I've been an Airbnb host for over a year, I'm a super host with over 100 reviews. I'm getting close to just giving up after this all happened.

1-a guest from Dubai stayed for a month. I live in a small town and he was harasing the young women that worked in the gas station and resteraunts. Someone filed a stalking complaint with the police. I coordinated with the PD and Airbnb so they could get background info on the guy. Turned out his government issued ID he uploaded to Airbnb was obviously fake. Airbnb does not do any vetting process to confirm the ID you upload is real. So it's a fake security measure.

2- I had a guest stay for 3 hours, then come down yelling and screaming about being disrespected. He said our house smelled like dog crap and my wife and I were yelling at each other while he was sleeping. Neither of which is true. He stormed out after trying to pick a fight with me. He later sent a request for all his money back. I denied since he checked in. Airbnb overruled my denial and took money out of my account to pay him back saying the stay was ""illegitimate"". He was able to leave a nasty and untruthful review on my profile that Airbnb refuses to take down. Even though they said the stay was illegitimate and he didn't stay he's allowed to have a review that hurts my future business. If you want to exploit this I suppose you could create a new account, book at your competitors places, leave, give 1 star and get your money back.",0.94,71,1558748558.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/bsp4im/be_cautious_if_you_are_interested_in_being_an/,True,31

After she had left the place a mess and had a party at the place, she left a 1 star review across the board and simply an emoji as a review. I had to call her multiple times to try to get a handle on the situation while she stayed.

A guest who broke multiple house rules, doesn’t pay for smoking fees or extra guests should be removed from the platform and not allowed to negatively effect my ratings, I work my butt off day in and day out making great unique stays for guests.

Strict policy so no refund unless cancelled nights are rebooked (especially during the peak holiday). Not happy, so finds a lot of things to complain about. We address them all to their and Airbnb’s satisfaction. “Not liking the neighborhood” isn’t a valid reason.

adad90b6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Kicked off Airbnb but guests continued to arrive and stay (no I did not get paid),"I was recently kicked off Airbnb because I entered the back vestibule of a house when a guest was there. I actually thought she was gone and I simply needed to plug in a wifi repeater for my next house over with new airbnb guests. But she was apparently in the house and later complained big time - I was kicked off the site within 24 hours and my 5 listings of 5 years with over 120 reviews, 5 star average, superhost status, really special unique places, all scrapped for good. The guest complained so viciously on top of that in her review and made up how she saw something was moved in the kitchen. One thing that was dumb on my part - when Airbnb called, I explained that I was simply trying to alert her to a minor safety issue (a nail sticking out of a board right in front of the bathroom door - which was true and I had proof via previous guest email about it).But the reality is I only entered the vestibule to address the wifi situation and had no idea it was going to blow up to such an ordeal.

Anyway Airbnb cancelled all my future reservations as well, which I had out for months so thousands of dollars of income was all erased.

IT GETS WORSE!!!!

I put my listing on VRBO immediately, got a very lucrative booking for a long weekend after the incident. I thought great - I can at least make some money back in the next week to catch up a bit. Maybe VRBO would be a great solution after all.

BUT THE NEXT AIRBNB GUEST STILL ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE THAT WEEKEND! I was out of town, and was not getting any messages from that new guest being that my account was closed. I had sent him entry instructions long ago. I guess Airbnb did not cancel this reservation even though they told me they cancelled everything. So when my VRBO guest arrived they called me saying someone was already there! There was nothing I could do to kick the Airbnb guest out! So the VRBO guests cancelled the reservation and I had to even pay a penalty on VRBO.

AND IT GETS EVEN WORSE!! The last Airbnb guest paid online, but I never even got the pay out!!!! So Airbnb kicked me off for something ridiculous, continued to let guests show up at my house, blocked the payment for that guest, and gave me no answer on the phone other than someone will get back to me (which they never did).

I don't know if anyone has any advice but it would be greatly appreciated. I feel horrible about the situation and just want to move on for the most part but the last part of this story is just so unbelievable. I really think the public should know about it and be cautious with Airbnb as it has clearly become ruthlessly haphazard and even turned to outright thievery.",0.93,68,1563251360.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/cdsbjk/kicked_off_airbnb_but_guests_continued_to_arrive/,True,65
adad923c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"My luck finally ran out with guests and AirBnB ""support""","I purchased my home in April of 2017 with the intention of living in the upstairs portion and fixing up and renting the lower Mother in Law apartment. Although I can afford the home without the rental income, I decided it was silly to reserve the entire upstairs for myself due to the extensive amount of traveling that I do between work and personal vacation. Plus it would allow me to upgrade the house much faster. I AirBnB my three upstairs bedrooms both when I am home and away, I have a long term tenant in the MIL apartment. As soon as I became eligible (10 bookings) I achieved Superhost and I have maintained it the entire time I've been hosting. I have hosted over 135 groups just in the last year. Any time an issue has come up in the past AirBnB has been quite helpful.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately this month my good luck finally ran out. Sure I've had my fair share of difficult people, broken things, and people breaking house rules, but this is the first time I've had to open a resolution. Due to a few problems I had previously, I have installed (and disclosed) a ring door bell and three cameras in the common areas of the house (hallways and kitchen). 

&#x200B;

The guest and her fiancee broke every house rule that I have (and there aren't that many)! They wore shoes in the house which required additional cleaning. They smoked in the house and opened the windows to do so. They rifled through a bunch of my personal items and drank from my private liquor collection, taking the most expensive items I had. They left after checkout time and left dishes in the sink. On the cameras G said ""I'm gonna rob this place sometime when we are not staying here"" and ""I feel like I should smoke weed in her house"" (in NJ-not legal) she also threatened and cursed at my cats as well as used racial slurs at them. In addition I am missing an ipad but I cannot prove that they took it.

&#x200B;

After their departure I sent a resolution to reimburse me for the additional cleaning as well as liquor consumption. The guest denied the smoking and said she ""thought they could help themselves to anything"". (I clearly detail in the listing as well as the welcome message the items for guest consumption). I escalated the case to AirBnB and sent them all of the videos of the guests breaking the house rules, consuming liquor and other offenses. They seemed helpful in the beginning but now that the guest wont allow them to charge their credit card the ""manager"" has stopped responding to my emails and when I called AirBnB the only offer is to let him know he should call me or get a new manager and start the entire process over again. It has been 2.5 weeks since I started the process and a week since I heard anything from the ""manager"".

&#x200B;

This has been an utterly disappointing experience and is making me question if it is even worth continuing to host on AirBnB since I'm not backed up in any way, shape, or form. AirBnB doesn't think that guest deserves to be banned or suspended from the site. They like to give guests the ""benefit of the doubt"". How many other guests are out there like this? It would be nice to see some sort of resolution instead of just being ignored! Any suggestions? Should I start over with a new manager or just take this one on the chin?

Well, this past week I stayed at a place where the host was the exact opposite. 

The only information we were given was where to pick up keys and the address, and it wasn't even the full address, just the street location, we had to message the host when we arrived to ask the apartment number. No other details what so ever. 

First message to the host was about Wi-Fi details, he responds. 

Second message was about how to open the back door (none of the 3 keys we had worked) and he says keys are in the kitchen drawer. After opening 8 different drawers we find the 4 keys for the single back door. Opening it should have had a manual of its own. 

Third message was to ask how to turn the patio lights on, host responds ""the switch"". There were many switches, none turned any lights on out there. Probably burnt out like half the other lights in the apartment.

Fourth message was to ask if there were any instructions for the washer since it only had symbols and no text on the 20 buttons/dials, host responds that ""all appliances are straightforward"". 

I stopped asking questions. The place was so close to being a really lovely space but the host clearly didn't prepare it for guests with much effort. And to think we paid almost $3k for the week for it. I have way more grievances I could list, still trying to figure out how to rate & review.

adada358-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Host living in my AirBnB,"Hello,

As a quick disclaimer, I’m a first time AirBnB user. So the rules on this type of thing are a little gray to me.

I’m currently on vacation with 6 other college friends, and we’re renting an entire house from AirBnB. After arriving, the host told us that they’ve had bad experiences in the past with college students partying and trashing their house. While my friends and I told her we’d be drinking, we’re all pretty quiet and responsible people. Overall, she seemed okay with everything as long as we were quiet and didn’t make a mess. As a side note, our host has an office in the first floor of the house. Now here comes the problem.

That night around 12pm, we were chilling in the kitchen drinking and talking when she suddenly came up from her office and “checked up” on us. And when we woke up his morning we found a spent cigarette on the deck, meaning she was hanging out there. We’re pretty sure that she’s sleeping in her office.

To make matters worse, this morning she woke us up at 4am when her dog started barking (which I guess must have been sleeping in the office). And then around 7am she had contractors moving in and out of the house while we were sleeping.

Note: She only told us about the contractor, her staying in the office, and that there is no air conditioning once we had already arrived and checked in. 

Here’s my question. Are AirBnB hosts allowed to stay if it is listed as renting the entire house? She’s a nice host, but the reason why we payed for an entire house is to get some privacy. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Tl;dr Our host is sleeping in the “office” of our AirBnB and visits periodically. We’re renting the entire house, is this allowed?

Edit: Just to provide some clarification, the host has an office with no bed in it, but it’s attached to a small bathroom. She is able to exit the office without coming into our space, however we cannot lock her office door on our side.

I am moving to Queretaro, which has an amazing tourist trade (it is a World Heritage site,) but looking at other Airbnb’s on line I don’t think I can justify $15 UDS a night. Heck. I usually have a $15 bottle of wine as a welcome gift. At some point it isn’t worth the pesos to iron sheets. 

Through three years, two locations in two different countries, I have seen a lot of change in Airbnb. Most have sadly not been for the good, but having had one nightmare guest from Booking.com, I know they haven’t hit bottom yet. And the guests I have had are still as wonderful as day one. 

I leave with never getting less than five stars except one four star for location. But I also leave not being a Superhost now as I have had long term guests who make it hard to get the required number of stays, they don’t count your reviews after you move (which is strange as it is superHOST not superLOCATIONS,) and where I am now has very seasonal guests. And while Superhost doesn’t really mean anything, it kind of validates all the work you do. My parting request, if I had one, to Airbnb would be get rid of Superhost or make it where it truly is about being super at hosting. Not quantity or location. 

So.....I will now live my life showering with all my leftover tiny shampoos and soap and missing having fascinating people share my space. Good luck to the rest of you continuing in the trenches.

Smoked weed in the unit, had extra guests at the unit (refused to pay the extra fees) and blasted music until 4AM. Upon leaving her an honest review about my experience hosting her, she messaged me saying that she’d make sure to have someone rent my listing only to leave a bad review. 

This was on Monday. Fast forward to today (Wednesday)and I have a guest book; check in and within minutes cancels the reservation — messes up the bed and closet to make it seem as though the unit is dirty. Writes trash 12 times all over a big map I allow guests to sign when they stay.

Would you think that this is a targeted scheme going on or mere coincidence? They both are from the same city and have mutual Facebook friends. I had to do some research on wtf is going on. 

UPDATE: The last guest claims that she never wrote anything on the map and that she never brought children into the unit (I have video proof of this). Furthermore, she said anymore contact would result in a communications harassment charge (mid conversation) and then proceeded to tell me she’s a police officer and will be coming back to the unit at noon today to speak with me AS AN OFFICER. If this is straight up abuse of authority, I don’t know what is.

UPDATE II: I felt like it was unethical to rent as a private citizen and then come back as an officer. So I called the precinct she said she is an officer at and they stated that no one works there with her name. So now, I have a past guest who has impersonated an officer.

Tim had 3 positive reviews and 1 terrible review. In the terrible review, the host warned others that Tim and his girlfriend had brought pets (even though they weren’t allowed) and left dog poop and pee pads all over the room.

I almost denied the request immediately (as I should have), but I messaged Tim to ask about the review. He said he didn’t know anything about it and that the host was lying. 

I figured, “Tim probably did bring a dog and let it shit everywhere. But I live there, I have a ring video doorbell, and I’ll be able to nip any shenanigans in the bud. I’ll give this guy the benefit of the doubt. I need the money, so I’ll approve it.”

This was one of the dumbest things I’ve ever done.

After approving the request I can see Tim’s full name (it isn’t Tim, by the way - it’s something really unique). I google his name and immediately panic, because what do I find? His unusual name, which HAS to be him, is listed on a public database (that is known to be accurate) showing that he’s been arrested for multiple counts of identify theft, financial fraud, and the like, all just a few months ago. This is EXACTLY the kind of garbage person that I don’t want in my house.

I freak out, immediately cancel the automated email that would have told him how to do the remote check in (just in time) and call Airbnb.

Here’s the good news: I explained the situation to Airbnb and they canceled the reservation for me with no penalty.

Here’s the bad news: his account is still active. They even helped him find other accommodations.

All this is to say, be SUPER careful with who you let stay in your house. I’m usually really strict about my requirements, and this time I let things slide that I shouldn’t. I almost endangered myself and everyone else in my home.

Replacing the broken items, repairing what could be repaired and cleaning stains out of rugs and furniture, cost me a total of £1193.

I called Airbnb on the day of checkout and raised a request for money through the resolution centre (guest had already left a five star review at this point, while receiving a one star review from me) on the same day.

I sent all of the necessary pictures to the guest when I raised the ticket (pictures of the damage and receipts).

Today I received a call from Airbnb.

Airbnb: Unfortunately we have found in the guest's favour as you haven't submitted any pictures to back up your claim.

Me: Huh? I submitted several pictures when I raised the dispute. If you need more pictures, I am happy to submit them now. What do you need?

Airbnb: Let me check. Can I put you on hold?

Me: OK.

Airbnb: I see the pictures now. You have submitted enough. However, you are supposed to contact Airbnb within 24 hours after check out. You didn't contact us until the 6th of September. You had other guests by then, so we can't accept any requests for additional payment through the resolution centre for this guest's booking.

Me: You're mistaken. I contacted you about the issue 10 minutes after they checked out. I also raised the request for money through the resolution centre on the day of check out.

Airbnb: Yes, but we had a backlog, so we weren't able to review your ticket until the 6th of September.

Me: That's not my fault. I opened the dispute on the day of checkout. The fact that Airbnb took six days to review it has nothing to do with me.

Airbnb: Our decision is final. This is clearly stated in the resolution centre. Even disregarding the issue with the date the dispute was made, we feel that £1193 is too much to ask for when the guest only paid £270 for their stay. Airbnb will be reimbursing you with a quarter of the amount you have requested at the company's own expense. This is a total of £298.25. We will be generously rounding this amount up to £300.

Blocked the neighbors driveway and filled the street with cars,"Here is a follow up to my post last night. I was posting updates in the comments but for those interested here is the full timeline and outcome. [LINK TO ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/dxi98l/guest_reports_one_guest_and_is_throwing_a_party/)

## Bad Guest (BG) timeline

Going forward I’ll refer to the “Bad Guest” as BG.

**October 30th** – BG books home for a single night and single guest. BG’s profile also notes that she lives in Seattle, which is about 15 minutes from the rental property. This might sound strange, but about half of our guests have been from the local area. BG messages us and asks for our phone number, we respond that we can be reached through the app, and that if they need anything we **live next door** so they can stop by.

BG does not respond and we do not hear from them again.

**November 16th (Check in day)** – We message BG with the login code and welcome them to the home. No response from BG.

The rest of the events take place on the date of check-in so I will be using timestamps from here forward.

**2:00PM** – We leave for a movie and dinner.

**8:00PM** – We return to the neighborhood to find the street filled with cars. Our driveway is blocked and I am unable to park.

**8:05PM** – I notice the rental’s windows are full of Balloons. I decided to stop by and check if the car belongs to the guest. I knock and the guest opens the door. The home is full of people and I notice all the furniture is moved. Looks to be about 20 or more people from what I can see. I notify them they are in violation of the rules and that they need to move their car. BG says they will move the car, and says they will wrap the party up.

**8:10PM** – I park my car and go inside my home. From what I can see the guests looked to be having a quiet and respectful party, even if it was against the rules. Since they said they are ending the party I decide that I will just charge them the extra guest rate and an additional cleaning fee.

**8:30PM** – I call AirBnB to notify them that the guest is in violation of house/AirBnB rules. They drop my call. I call back 3 more times, each time AirBnB drops my call when “transferring” my call.

**8:40PM** – I finally get through to a case manager, tell them the situation and they ask if I would like to cancel the reservation. I told them they informed me the party is being wrapped up so I just would like to get an additional cleaning and guest fee. They give me instructions for doing that through the app. I slowly see families with children trickle out of the house. It looks like the party is wrapping up.

**9:00PM-9:30PM** – More guests arrive, many carrying six packs and bottles of alcohol. Mostly younger people in their 20s. People spill out onto the deck, people can be seen drinking and smoking.

**9:30PM** – I message the guest and tell them to stop the party immediately. No response. I call AirBnB and get assigned a case manager who is extremely rude from the start of the conversation. I tell them I want the reservation canceled and the guest to notified they need to leave the property. AirBnB case manager notifies me I will not get the reservation or cleaning fee money, I ask if the guest is going to be refunded, the case manager says no they will not be refunded. 

Confused I ask the case manager why AirBnB would keep the money for themselves due to someone breaking policy. Case manager tells me nobody is getting the money and it is just “gone.” I decide to deal with this later, and ask them to just have the reservation canceled. Case manager tells me they will contact the guest and get back to me.

**10:30PM** – More people arrive; no word from AirBnB. I call AirBnB and get a new case manager who tells me they are recovering from a cold, they sound very sick, but are extremely helpful. She informs me that they are unable to find the original case manager, and are unsure if she has left. The new case manager takes over my case and contacts the guest. Guest hangs up on case manager and sends calls from AirBnB to voicemail. New case manager informs me that the previous case manager was misinformed and I will still receive payout and the cleaning fee.

**10:40PM** – I head next door and start knocking on the door. I hear yelling inside but its in a language I do not understand. I continue knocking and they refuse to open the door or speak to me.

**10:45PM** – I call the police.

**11:00PM** – Police arrive. I speak to them and they ask if the person has a reservation, I tell them they did but it was canceled due to violation of house rules, and AirBnB policy. They tell me I need to give them their money back. I tell them that I don’t have the money and it’s held by AirBnB.

Police still haven’t spoken with the guest or approached the house. I inform them that the house is licensed, I have a local business license, and by local city and fire code it is illegal for me to even allow parties in a short term rental or have this many people on the premises. They ask me to return to my home and they’ll speak with the guest.

After speaking with the guest they come back and tell me they can’t ask them to leave because this is a “civil matter.” The police also tell me that “99% of the people there are extremely intoxicated and we really don’t want them on the road, we prefer if they stay through the night.”

So, the police inform me they won’t ask people who are now trespassing on my property to leave, and shame me for wanting them to leave.

**12:00AM** – I hear banging outside and see the guests are throwing trash into my compost bins and look to be leaving. I watch as they carry limp bodies out of the house, they lay one girl on the porch and allow her to throw up on the floor before loading her into a car.

**12:15AM** – While loading people into a car they put it in neutral and it begins to roll down the hill, almost crushing two people between it and another car. After lots of screaming and people scrambling around the car they get it into park, blocking my driveway again.

**12:30AM** – Guests are blocking the entire street with cars as they figure out who is able to drive. They begin leaving; they attempt to abandon the car in front of my driveway. I tell them to move the car and someone jumps inside of it and parks it two houses down (it’s still there currently.)

**12:40AM** – Guests are gone and I head over the access the house. The porch is covered in vomit. Dining room and kitchen floors are covered in some sticky substance. Paintings and artwork is removed from the walls and stored in one of the bedrooms. Small stains on chairs and couch. Random pieces of trash are scattered around.

Dirty, but overall no major damage.

adadc4f0-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,How to write a review like an Airbnb pro!,"I have been a host, super host, and guest on Airbnb for about 8 years, and have learned a lot about Airbnb as a business, a community, and a travel platform.

I see a lot of posts here about whether or not to include something in a review. Here are a few guidelines on review writing as an Airbnb guest:

1. No matter what, add at least one thing you liked about the place, location, or host. If you can't think of one thing, you are probably not level-headed enough to write an honest review. Come back later, try again.
2. If you had an issue while staying at the Airbnb... did you contact the host about it first?  
a) If yes,... did the host respond timely and did the host do everything in their power to fix it?                                                                                                                                         ----If yes...Don't include it negatively in the review. Feel free to comment on their responsiveness though.                                                                                                                         ----If no... Include this in the review, the issue and that it was not resolved by the host.    
b) If no... contact the host before you write a review. Give them a chance to correct the issue or compensate for it before writing the review.
3. If you had an issue about the Airbnb that is out of the host's control (i.e. location of the airbnb, construction noise near by, weather or natural disasters, traffic in the area, neighbors, etc)     
  a) If it is a temporary issue- think carefully before including it in the review, ask yourself: Will it affect future guests enough to be worth including a permanent negative remark?  
  b) If it is a permanent issue AND NOT ALREADY ADDRESSED ON THE AIRBNB PROFILE BY THE HOST- Include it in the review. Give a heads up to future guests that may not be aware of the issue.
4. Add personality and detail to your review.                                                                                      If you liked the place and had a good time be sure to include why. Write about that specific thing that made the place fun and different from a standard hotel or other Airbnbs. Vague reviews tend to imply unaddressed issues the guest was too timid to report.
5. Don't deduct stars without explaining why, for both the hosts and the guests sake.              If cleaning was 3 out 5, say why. Let the host know (ahead of time is better-see #2 above). Nothing is more frustrating than reading a positively written review and then seeing low star ratings without explanation.
6. Don't write negative comments based on unrealistic expectations.                                Manage your expectations. Are paying $50 a night but upset their isn't high-end bedding? Did you knowingly book an old farmhouse, but upset that the floors are a little creaky? Are you staying in a tropical place, but outraged that bugs came in the house when you left the door open? You get the point. Know what you are booking and ask questions ahead of time if the expectations are not clear.
7. Read before you book or review!                                                                                                   If you haven't already, read through the ENTIRE profile and house manual for the Airbnb (see #3b and #6). Many of the issues you may feel inclined to comment on are already in the profile. Hosts understand the pros and cons of their spaces. They are more likely than not to provide that information ahead of time. If you review based on something addressed in the profile, it is just very obvious you booked blindly and reflects negatively on you as a reviewer/guest.

&#x200B;

Overall Just Be Fair!

Believe it or not, hosts sometimes read the reviews you have posted before accepting your booking. They want to determine if you will review them fairly. Stick to these guidelines above to help you write honest and effective reviews and become a valuable member of the Airbnb community.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps!

Our conversation made me uncomfortable. It also included, ""Africans and Jews have low IQs and shouldn't interbreed with Europeans.""

Other than that she has been friendly. I'm torn about wether or not to include it in my review. She asked if we could talk politics before going into details, but.... Wow! I've never heard someone, in person, defend Hitler and tell me the gas chambers were fake.

adadc7f2-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Problems w/AirBnB Support? Take them to Small Claims Court! (I just won $2,000)","New to posting on Reddit, but just wanted to share some info that made me feel empowered.

I had a disagreement with AirBnB support--I asked for a $300 refund, they offered $100.  I was not happy, so I looked into Small Claims court.

Turns out, you have to file in the Defendant's home area (SF, in this case). However, since there is an AirBnB development office in Seattle, the State of Washington requires a ""Registered Agent"" for out-of-state businesses to have a presence.

I filed a Small Claims case against AirBnB Payments, Inc via their Registered Agent in Tumwater, WA in June ($29 filing fee) for ""Breach of Contract"" with the Thurston County District Court.  I received a court date (August 22, 2018) and had a Process Server serve the notice to the Registered Agent ($85).  I figured that, since AirBnB was being unreasonable, I would ask for a full refund (\~$1200) some damages ($300), and my time in dealing with all the BS (10 hours based upon my current salary) for a total of \~$1800

Showed up yesterday in Olympia to argue my case (it was pretty weak, when I actually did some research).  AirBnB didn't send anyone, so I had a default judgement in my favor.  The judge ordered my full amount + filing and service fees for a total of $2009.55.  I spoke 4 words (Yes sir. Thank you.)  I was there by 8:30am (court time was 9am), and out by 11am.

I'm not sure I would have won under argument, but the great thing about Small Claims Court is that LAWYERS ARE NOT ALLOWED! Which means--if nothing else--AirBnB would have to have sent some random manager to defend their interests.  After my 2-month frustration with AirBnB Support I determined that the inconvenience to them would have been worth it, even if I lost.

Now I just have to collect my dollars.  Fun times.

​ ***edited post*** Update: i removed the details on “how to” since it was pointed out to me that AirBnB TOS forces binding arbitration (costs $200, link in the TOS). I’m begging to withdraw my claim so I don’t get counter-sued.  Leaving the rest so maybe someone else as dumb as me will learn from my stupidity.

&#x200B;

Update July 2019: I dropped the issue since the amount I was originally trying to get back was around $300...I'd already spent \~$200 and arbitration was another \~$200...I figured that even if I won I would be even more in the hole, so it wasn't worth it. AirBnB never counter-sued me (and time is up to do so) so I supposed I could go back and try to get the judgement. But then I'd risk having my account suspended from violating the TOS. $2k isn't worth that to me at this point.",0.87,62,1535039985.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/99olk5/problems_wairbnb_support_take_them_to_small/,True,57
adadc96e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Rant: Guest accuses my cleaning lady of stealing her birth certificate,"Guest has a one night booking. She booked approximately one week ago for a Saturday stay. She calls me Saturday morning wanting to cancel. I ask why? She says, it's raining and doesn't want to drive in the rain.

I reply that's not a valid reason to cancel, but I will allow it minus 15% of the base rate. She would be on the hook for any fees. She decides to come anyway. Great.

Fast forward to checkout. She calls two hours past check out in a panic. Someone in her group lost her ticket and birth certificate. Things she needs to get on her cruise. My cleaner is at the apartment turning over the unit, so no biggie. Guest heads over to look for her items.

She makes my cleaner go through FIVE full bags of garbage to find this envelope. Nowhere to be found. She wants to check the other units she's cleaning, units the guest NEVER entered.

Guest calls again in a panic and says, ""I think your cleaner took the birth certificate.""

I tell her, my cleaners save things like random shoe strings, lost socks, pamphlets for conventions, brochures, half used deodorant. Things I wish she'd throw away. There's no way that she took it. She loves working for me. It allowed her to start her own business and has three people working for her. A year ago, she was schlepping her infant around with her as she cleaned. Now she's a boss. She's moving on up to the american middle class.

Guest says, ""She doesn't speak American good and she's probably illegal or something like that.""

Me: She is a legal resident of the U.S.A. I report her income. She even LLC'ed her own company. She's not going to jeopardize her job with me over this.

Her: Can you come and search her?

Me: No. I have absolutely no reason to doubt her or anything she says. Perhaps your kid left those documents at home, which seems more likely than my cleaner stealing the documents. Where did your kid see the documents last?

Her: At home, but how do you know she isn't trying to sell her birth certificate on the black market?

Me: Because she's not shady like that. She's an honest, humble, god fearing type of person.

Her: How do you know that?

Me: She won't even take tips that guests leave for her. She's had chances to take diamond earrings, jewelry, laptops, ipads, phones you name it. She has never taken a thing. 

Honestly, I do not like this line of questioning. I'm not coming by to search her person. I've allowed you to search the apartment, and apartments you and your party never set a foot in. You had my cleaner go through five bags of garbage looking for this thing. I feel like we've gone above and beyond.

She goes off on me about how I ruined her vacation. I remind her that I didn't lose her daughter's boarding documents. Guest even admits that daughter is forgetful and probably left it at home, but my reluctance to strip search my cleaning person is ""bad customer service.""

Fuck this biotch.

adadcaea-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Unsure if I should leave a review for a creepy guest I had,"So I just had a guest that left my wife and I feeling extremely uncomfortable. I called airbnb and am waiting to hear back from a case manager, but I'm not sure if I should leave a review for this guest to warn other hosts/guests about him. 

My wife and are lesbians, both college-aged, and that is something I subtly mention in my profile to discourage discriminative guests. I believe our middle-aged guest, Abdul, was trying to act on some fantasy of his with us. When he first arrived, he did not bring any of his luggage to the door with him, which I thought was a little weird, but I shrugged it off. He came inside and pretty much insisted that we sit down and talk with him for well over 30 minutes. He asked us all sorts of questions about our lives. This was a little weird to us because most guests just say hi and that's it. Looking back on it, I think he was trying to scope us out before deciding he wanted to stay with us. After talking to us, he finally went to grab his luggage and a gift he had for us, a large bottle of hard liquor. Once again, we just shrugged it off as this guy just being nice. I should mention that Abdul is an airbnb host himself. He owns several large mansions that he rents out for very high prices. He said he was a doctor and it was obvious that he was wealthy (he kept bragging about it), which made us wonder why he decided to book a room at our little $40 a night condo. Anyway, Abdul insisted that we go to lunch witch him. My wife and I are pushovers, and while we thought this was weird, we weren't super creeped out yet so we said yes. While we were at lunch, Abdul started making plans for us to watch a movie with him back at our condo. We were trying to come up with excuses not to, but he kept working around them. He also said that he had booked two other places for the next two nights but, since he liked us, he cancelled them and insisted on staying with us and paying us cash for the extra days. We tried to say we'd be out of town the next day, but he said something along the lines of, ""that's perfect, then when you get back you can spend time with me."" I then told him that we were considering staying an extra day and he told me no very sternly because he ""would be lonely."" He also kept joking about staying up late with us and partying (no doubt, with the alcohol he gave us). At this point, we were really starting to feel uncomfortable but we felt sort of stuck because he kept working around the excuses we were making. On the way home, he made us get a movie to watch with him on our couch. While we were watching it, Abdul kept getting closer and closer to my wife. At one point, he put his arm behind her while not quite touching her. I started texting my father to let him know what was going on and requested his help with the situation. Abdul told me twice to put my phone down and watch the movie, so I excused myself to go to the restroom and called my father. When I returned, I found Abdul massaging my wife's feet with her foot on his thigh. My wife looked terrified and helpless. She later told me that he did not ask to touch her, he just started playing doctor and pretended like something was wrong with her foot. I told Abdul that my father was coming to pick up some mail and he put my wife's foot down after a few minutes. Once my father came in and introduced himself (he is very intimidating), Abdul's demeanor completely changed. He became very quiet and did not look at my father once. He looked like a puppy that had just got caught doing something bad. My father was able to pretend that my wife and I had plans with him and we ended up packing our stuff and stayed at his house for the night. He also told Abdul that he could not stay two extra nights at the condo like he wanted to. On our way out of the condo, Abdul kept asking when we would be back because he wanted to spend time with us. Abdul tried calling me the next morning, but I just texted him to leave the keys on the counter and pretended like we weren't completely uncomfortable with everything he did. I realize that my wife and I should have been more stern with Abdul, but in the moment, we felt so helpless because he was so persistent and overbearing. So now I'm wondering if I should leave a review for him. I realize that if I leave a review, this could damage his ability to book with other hosts and possibly future guests he might have if they decide to read my review. However, I don't want Abdul taking advantage of other women like he did with my wife and I. I'd like to warn them about his intentions so they can refrain from booking with him. When I called airbnb, the representative said I should hold off on the review for now and wait to hear back from the case manager. But as I mentioned before, Abdul had two other bookings for the next two nights that he cancelled. I'm guessing he will book with other female hosts in the near future, so I'd like for them to be warned as soon as possible. But I'm also afraid of Abdul contacting me after I write the review. Any advice here?

TLDR; Creepy middle-aged doctor booked a room with my wife and I (college-aged lesbians). He becomes increasingly persistent that we spend all our time with him and started massaging my wife's feet without asking her. Unsure if I should leave a review for him.

1 older man books our house, and responds like normal. Hours before check in he stops replying to messages.  Suddenly I am receiving calls from strangers asking for check in information.  I immediately reported this to support.  The support team ends up telling me that I should send the check in instructions to a different phone number than was registered with me!  WTF!

I call support again (30 min wait time), and they ask me to just call the 3rd party number and ask them to leave.  At this point, my concern is that clearly the account used to book is NOT the guest and thus any damage falls on me. Airbnb then says that any damage may be covered by them but they cant guarantee.

Police called and we go to the door to evict them.  As the door opens weed smoke rolls out of the door.  The place was absolutely chonged out.

adadd256-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Please don’t rely on your guests to clean up after themselves!,"Sorry this is a bit of an essay. 

TL;DR: AirBnB give full refund for insect infestation and filthy property for the sake of a cleaning fee. 

My wife and I decided to rent a villa in Florida for a couple of weeks. It wasn’t cheap but had 7 five star reviews and the hosts were “super hosts”. 

We arrived late at night after almost 22 hours of travelling and headed straight to bed. 

The first thing we did was check the bedding. It didn’t smell clean and there were mysterious stains. Grim. But there was plenty of clean bedding in the closet so we changed it and went to bed. 

The next morning we woke up and headed into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. We were met with hundreds of ghost ants scurrying around all the surfaces. 

We had a closer look and found them to be attracted to the foods that had been dropped/spilt everywhere around the kitchen. This is when we started getting concerned. 

Upon closer inspection of all the surfaces, carpets, floors, utensils - basically everything, you could see it hadn’t been cleaned properly in a long time. All rooms were dirty and there were even adult toys left abandoned under the bedside units. 

The bed sizes were also advertised incorrectly (which was important to us as my wife is pregnant and needs more space when sleeping). 

We called the hosts who immediately went to blame us for leaving food out. Considering we hadn’t eaten at the property yet we were shocked they assumed this was our fault. 

They suggested we clean up and use ant killer (just what we want to do on our vacation). We told them that ant killer would only temporarily stop the issue and they need to get pest control out. They agreed but were unwilling to do anything more about the filthy conditions. They ignored any further communication. 

We started documenting everything. We took about 50 photos and videos of live/dead bugs, droppings, stains etc and made sure to send every one via AirBnB to the hosts. The hosts still ignored us. 

After 12 hours we decided to escalate it to AirBnB. They asked for all the photos/videos and got back to us within 6 hours. A full refund was issued with no hassle at all and we are now leaving this absolute crap hole. 

But before we did leave someone from pest control turned up and did a survey. It turns out there are multiple ants nests, rodent droppings and spiders that could poison us. 

The one thing that this AirBnB had compared to others; no cleaning fee (we didn’t notice this when booking). The hosts have relied on previous guests to clean up after themselves for years and nobody has checked to see if they were. 

So dear hosts and guests, for the sake of ruining your homes/vacations, please don’t cheap out on cleaning. It may cost you more in the long run. Also make sure you document everything via AirBnB if you do have troubles. 

Edit: Just to add a kudos to AirBnB and how they dealt with this. We called at 9pm (Florida time) and had a resolution by 3am. They kept us updated and were very helpful throughout. 

Edit2: An update if anyone is interested. AirBnB have stopped allowing bookings and advised they will need a pest control certificate before they allow it to be rented again. 

A review has been left and we’ve still not heard from the hosts.

Edit3 (As this post seems to be getting some attention still): The hosts left feedback for us and completely ignored the issues. Pest control were apparently “liars” and we also lied about everything as well, despite the 50+ photos. 

Strangely our complaint about the bed size issue was the main focus of their review.  They really were upset we said they were advertised differently. Amazingly though, the listing still says “King Bed” when they are actually Queen size... 

They are still “Superhosts”.",0.93,63,1554134061.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/b84728/please_dont_rely_on_your_guests_to_clean_up_after/,True,30

This absolutely blows my mind and, looking back at a recent experience of my own, I think it's high time airbnb addresses this problem.

Allow me to share my own experience: a while back a guest left me a false review. Long story short, he misread my listing's description, was annoyed by the inconvenience that his mistake caused him, and decided to leave me a 1-star review as a result. Just like that. Luckily he actually wrote in the review that my listing stated something that it didn't - so it was an easy case to get airbnb to remove it - or so I thought.

**1) Airbnb has no policy in place for removing false reviews**

You can actually ""report"" reviews, but airbnb only accepts a few limited reasons for such reports: *""You can respond to reviews, but you can't delete them. To promote trust and transparency in our community, we won't delete reviews unless they violate our* [*content policy*](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/546/)*.""* And when you look up the content policy, it doesn't say that false reviews can be removed.

**2) Airbnb is not responsive when false reviews do happen**

When I got in touch with airbnb about the problem, they responded with a mix of: a) great delays in getting back to me (I had to follow up a few times); b) unwillingness to remove the review; c) stating I could make my case in writing a review about the guest (??!). It took well over a dozen exchanges to finally take the review down.

**3) Even if the false review if removed, Airbnb does not compensate the host nor punish the guest**

**3.a)** Compensation for the host: as a result of the false 1-star review (and Airbnb's great delay in addressing it), I lost superhost status as well as an indeterminate number of guests deterred by seeing that 1-star review. This amounts to direct financial loss which Airbnb didn't offer compensation for.

**3.b)** Punishing the guest: the guest did something wrong, purposefully and with malicious intention. There should be some form of punishment for this. The punishment could be financial, a warning/ban, and/or one that could inform future hosts that this guest has at least once written a false review.

It should be noted that the matter of compensation/punishment is not something Airbnb simply overlooked, in my experience: I spent weeks arguing with them that *something* should be done to punish this behaviour (even if I wouldn't get compensation) but Airbnb *actively disagreed*.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I'm genuinely grateful to airbnb for the service it offers me. I'm supportive of the platform and don't necessarily subscribe to much of the criticism that is made about it.

However, this particular issue seems very serious to me. Airbnb is built on trust, reputation, and good behaviour. If false reviews and malicious behaviour are allowed to spread, it harms everyone.

Airbnb should step up to the plate and fix the way they deal with these issues.",0.93,62,1559163207.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/buk1gt/false_reviews_by_guests_are_a_serious_problem/,True,70
adade412-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Host switched address to get more money from me, is still marked as “Superhost”, clearly has scammed others. What do I do to ensure this doesn’t happen to other people?","I booked an Air Bnb through my job because I was going to work for the same company in LA for 5 days. I booked the air bnb on the same street as the mall I was going to be working at, as I didn’t want to deal with traffic and the listing was advertised as on this street and also confirmed via the address when I paid and booked. This was in Los Angeles and I’m a 25 year old female traveling alone. 

I was working all day and couldn’t check in until 7 PM and I let the host know this. He said this was fine. When I messaged him asking about check-in because it was advertised as Self, he told me he would text me. He then sent me a text message with a different address over 3 miles away, not even in the same neighborhood. I told him that this was not the address I had booked and that I was not comfortable coming to an unverified address, as the address on the listing has been verified with Air Bnb. 

He kept trying to tell me that “everyone is usually okay with the switch” and that “it wasn’t that far away” and I told him that regardless of the switch, this is a SAFETY CONCERN because I’m a female traveling alone and shouldn’t be going to an address you’re texting me outside of the platform messenger.

I called Air Bnb and the customer service wasn’t much help as they didn’t seem to understand that it was getting late and I needed a place to stay. The host told them that “the address was the same as in the photos” even though this was impossible because he has another listing on the street he was trying to switch me to, but this is his *actual residence* and he only rents out ONE ROOM, not to mention the lack of amenities I specifically was paying for such as a kitchen, patio, gym, pool, etc. Air bnb didn’t care about the safety aspect and wouldn’t refund me for nearly 5 hours- I had to book ANOTHER booking on a company card and they eventually refunded me and only gave me a $200 credit. 

Upon further investigating, it looks like this host does this every time and moves people to this other place and actually lives in the one with more amenities? He charges $189 for the unit I booked then moves guests to his $89 a night booking if it’s not being used. He tried scamming me out of over $400 including service fees, which are more for his more expensive listing.

Air Bnb told me they’d be removing his superhost badge and nothing has happened. They keep closing my chats with them, and I told them I’d file a police report for petty theft/ scamming if they don’t address the issue.

I've been Airbnb-ing one room in my house for a year. The other rooms are occupied by myself and some roommates, and I am the leaseholder/person in charge. Lately it seems that I've had guest after guest that are just clueless, inconsiderate, and almost unbelievably stupid.   


Airbnb at its core was intended to be about sharing the home you live in. I know now it's expanded to people renting out entire homes etc, but I am one of those that is sharing a space with the guests, and that's clearly stated in the listing. 

Last night a guest whose flight was delayed arrived at 2AM (originally supposed to arrive at 10). This was absolutely not their fault of course. but they made such a racket coming in the house, and they WALKED INTO my roommates bedroom while she was sleeping. This was AFTER they had already entered their own bedroom, and the bathroom, both of which have clear signs on the doors. So what the fuck were they doing entering another room? She couldn't go back to sleep for an hour and the racket woke both my dogs up, which then woke up the whole house.

I am livid, of course, but this is not the first time guests have just tried to enter random rooms in my house. I've of course had the other usual problems, like guests trying to throw unauthorized parties, and being inconsiderate with the commons spaces, etc. But guys, I am tired. I'm tired of people's total stupidity. After a full year of putting up signs and instructions and directions galore, it still seems like I am putting up all kinds of signs that should just be fucking obvious: ""do not enter"" on the other bedroom doors. ""Knock before entering"" on the bathroom door (sometimes my roommates neglect to lock the bathroom door when they're in there, hence the sign). And even though there are very clear directions on the Airbnb room regarding the lock on that door, once in a while people are still completely confused as to how to operate a basic damn lock. All the little stupid things just add up and I'm sooo tired.

I've recently stayed at an AirBnB in Berlin, and the day after leaving the host charge me for a brand new (still in the box) missing iPad. The host said they bought the iPad the day I checked in. Neither me nor my friends took the iPad, but AirBnB sides with them and charges me 1,300 euros. Even after my rebuttal, AirBnB still sides with the host because the host has sufficient ""documentation"".  Upon my request to see the documentation AirBnB said they are going to stop communicating with me.

The case in general is a bit sketchy, as the host dropped the key in a restaurant for me to pick up, and after checkout we left the key under the door mat. The host accuses us further of using their terrace, which we did not use. I'm really curious what actually happened, but more I'm concerned about getting charged an absurd sum for something I did not do. Is there anything I can do about this matter? It's also kinda odd that a host would leave a brand new, still in the package iPad in the apartment. Note that we have never seen said iPad.

adadf60a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,It happened to me: Airbnb’s $1 million guarantee is garbage [host],"I didn't pay much attention to host horror stories before I started hosting myself. I knew Airbnb offered a $1 million guarantee and felt confident I was covered if any damage occurred. I want to share my story here with the hope of helping new hosts avoid the problem I experienced.

Info like this is all over this subreddit, but it wasn't until I had a problem that I started paying attention. Of course.

Two months ago a very nice guest accidentally created a large hole in my wall. We were both present when the incident happened; she apologized profusely and agreed to cover the cost (“just send me a bill”). I had guests checking in a few hours later, so I called Airbnb to asked them what I should do. They told me to take pictures and upload them, plus a receipt of the repair, to the Resolution Center. The incident, they told me, needed to be resolved directly with the guest. Fine.

You guessed it: I went through the Resolution Center, initiating a claim a little more than one week later, but the guest never paid. She stopped replying to my messages. When I finally involved Airbnb, they told me that this was not covered by the guarantee because I had ""another guest check into [my] listing before opening the resolution center.""

Never mind that this guest was checking in the same day the damage occurred. Never mind that I could not have asked for payment before that, as it took me about 10 days after the accident to get it repaired. (How could I have asked for payment when I didn't have a price or receipt?)

I'm lucky this was only a few hundred dollars. I've read about hosts being on the hook for much more.

Hosts, learn from me:
*Make sure ALL communication goes through Airbnb. Don’t text your guests; always message them through the website or app.
*Don’t leave a review until you get your reimbursement. Make it clear to the guest that you are waiting for a resolution before you review them.

adadf77c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Host left negative review because I wasn't social enough for them?,"I've used airbnb maybe a dozen or more times, most recently for a 10 day business trip abroad. I was out of the apartment from 7:30 AM-10 PM most days of my trip; the times I was there were either short runs in and out to get something/take a quick nap, or at night to sleep. 

I met my hosts on the first day and mentioned I was there on business. We chatted for 2-3 minutes then I retired to my room as I was super jet lagged. The remaining days I would say hello to them when I left in the AM and hello/good night when I returned but they didn't ask me questions or make small talk, which was fine by me. I was mostly exhausted having to be ""on"" for meetings all day, so when I was at the airbnb I was mostly decompressing in my room or sleeping. It was a small apartment with no real ""common area"" to hang out so I stuck to my room. 

After I returned I left my usual nice review. The review the host left of me described me as ""quiet and withdrawn"" and said they wished they had gotten to know me better (it also said I was ""friendly and polite"" so, ok?). I wrote back saying I was sorry we didn't chat more but I was out all day on business/jet lagged for much of the trip and not feeling very social, but reiterating that I enjoyed my stay.

The great irony is that I wasn't social with them because I was drained from putting on my extrovert act for 12-14 hours a day (and doing very well at it I might add, my meetings were extremely productive). 

My questions are: is this negative review going to make it harder for me to book in the future? I've never had a host complain that I was too quiet for them! Do hosts really expect socialization from guests who are on business trips? If so wouldn't it be partly their responsibility to initiate small talk or invite me to chat over coffee or whatever?",0.92,58,1568235928.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/d2x003/host_left_negative_review_because_i_wasnt_social/,True,27
adadf8f8-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guest Accuses me of Refusing to Refund her Because I'm Racist - Airbnb Refund her,"Back in March, a guest booked my place for for a weekend in June. Two hours before check-in, she told me that she had a change of plans and wanted a full refund.

I offered to refund if I could rebook the weekend (which was extremely likely as I am fully booked every weekend). She refused to accept my offer and kept her booking open for the weekend, ensuring that nobody else could rebook. She insisted that I had to cancel, even after I informed her of the penalties hosts incur for cancelling bookings.

The day after check out she left the expected one star review. I also received a request for money through the resolution centre. She claimed that the reason I hadn't refunded her was because I was a racist. She stated that I would have refunded her if she was white, but because she's Asian I refused to refund her.

I declined the refund request, stating that I offered to refund her if I could rebook and she refused to cancel. I said that this had nothing to do with her race and that I uphold the same policies when a guest wants to cancel no matter what their ethnicity. I also left a note for Airbnb pointing out how ridiculous her claim was as I have done the same when white people book my listing.

A few days later she involved Airbnb in the dispute. They found in favour of the guest and provided her with a full refund. I also received an e-mail warning me about how seriously they take discrimination. I was told that if it happens again, I will be banned for life.

I responded to the e-mail asking how I was supposed to have racially discriminated against her by not giving her a full refund for a last minute cancellation. Airbnb never replied.

I phoned up and discovered that they had closed the ticket. I asked to have it re-opened. They told me they would get back to me in 72 hours. They never did. I phoned back and was told the ticket was closed again. They offered to re-open it. They never got back to me.

I eventually reached out to them via Twitter, but they have been ignoring me for almost a month now.

adadfa6a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guest Cancels then Lies to Airbnb to try to get a Full Refund,"A guest booked my private room for five people today and turned up with six. I let it slide and ended up regretting it.

The guests left after midnight due to one of their friends being involved in an accident. They have gone to visit him in hospital and will no longer be staying.

They thought this entitled them to a full refund, despite having been in my listing for over ten hours and having slept in the beds. Both Airbnb and I disagreed.

The guests then lied to Airbnb claiming that there wasn't a bedroom here and there was only a living room to sleep in. They also lied about the location of the bathroom, claiming that they had to go through my bedroom to access it. Neither of the two bedrooms have an en suite. The bathroom is accessible from the landing. The only room you have to pass through to go upstairs is the living room.

Airbnb called me to tell me that I had committed a hosting violation and was under investigation. I am now in the process of proving that the guests are lying, which is hopefully going to be pretty easy. I was also told that the guests were cancelling their booking (although it still hasn't been cancelled).

While I was on the phone, the guests left with the keys. I sent them a message asking them when they would be returning the keys and didn't get a response. I called Airbnb an hour later to let them know that I would have to have the locks changed if the keys weren't returned before the next guest checks in tomorrow and would be charging today's guest for this. Airbnb agreed that the guest would have to pay for this if they didn't return them in time for the next guest.

As I was having the conversation, the guests returned with the keys and told me that they would be taking pictures of my home to help them get a refund.

They took a load of pictures of the living room and went to leave. I asked them if they were going to take pictures of the bedroom that supposedly didn't exist and the bathroom, which is supposedly only accessible through my bedroom. They went upstairs, took one picture of each room (which they obviously aren't going to submit to Airbnb) and left.

**Update:**

The payment has been withheld and the investigation is still ongoing. I called Airbnb earlier and was told that my case manager was currently on the phone and would call me after he finished the call. That was seven hours ago.

I called back again an hour ago and got the same story.

**Update #2:**

Airbnb saw through her lies and closed the investigation. I have not been penalised and I have been paid in full.

However, despite knowing that the guest had lied to try and get a refund, Airbnb want to give her a partial refund as she didn't stay overnight.

I have been hosting for three years. Up until two weeks ago, I had spoken to one guy who couldn't understand English. In the past two weeks, I have spoken to four.

I have had the following conversations:

#1

Me: Adam has just told me that it's actually his cousin Wendy and her husband Joe staying and he won't be staying at the listing himself. Adam has violated Airbnb's terms and conditions as third party bookings are not permitted. This booking needs to be cancelled.

Airbnb: I understand you want to cancel your guest's booking because your listing is not available on that date. There are penalties for this...

Me: No, that's not what I said at all. I said it was a third party booking and the guest has violated Airbnb's terms and conditions.

Airbnb: I understand you want to cancel your guest's booking because you don't want to host on those dates. There are...

Me: No, that's not what I said at all. I am going to have to end this call and call back to speak to somebody else.

#2

Me: My guest is over 24 hours late for check in. I have contacted them, but I don't seem to be able to get in touch with them. Are you able to reach out to them to find out if they are still checking in?

Airbnb: I understand you have missed your check in and are looking for a refund.

Me: No. I am the host, not the guest. My guest is over 24 hours late for check in, I am trying to find out if they will still be checking in, but I cannot get in touch with them.

Airbnb: I understand you want to move your check in date forward one day. You can...

Me: No. I didn't say that. I am going to call back and speak to somebody else.
____________

#3

Me: So my guest was caught smoking by the pool and I have been handed a $50 fine. It's the first time this has happened. Are you going to need more than the notice for the fine I have been given for the guest to pay for this?

Airbnb: I understand you have been caught smoking in your host's no smoking property.

Me: No. I am the host. My guest was caught smoking.

Airbnb: I understand you have been caught smoking in your host's no smoking property.

Me: I didn't say that. I am going to have to end this call and call back to speak to somebody else.

#4

Me: My guest has just cancelled their booking, telling me that they have had a change of plans and will not be checking into my listing. They are asking for a full refund. However, as their check in is in two days time and they have had these dates blocked on my calendar for four months, I am only willing to refund the dates I am able to rebook. I have already relayed this information to the guest. Please leave a note saying that I will refund the dates I can rebook, so that you don't have to call me to ask me if I will refund them if the guest calls you.

Airbnb: I understand you want to provide your guest with a full refund. Don't worry. I can do that for you.

Me: No! Do not do that! That is not what I said at all. Do not do anything! I am going to end this call and call back to speak to somebody else.

adae07c6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"AirBnB property manager is demanding we cancel and threatening to have us ""arrested on sight"" if we attempt to enter the property as scheduled.","So, long story short, we've had this place booked for several weeks now for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Two nights ago, we received an *exceptionally* long text message (via the app) containing tons of house rules that were not originally contained within the ad.  Some is purely normal common sense stuff I expect anywhere, like cleaning up after yourself, taking the trash out, etc.  One somewhat odd one was no playing music outside by the pool (not just quiet/respectful/low volume, but \*zero\* music period).  Fine, no big deal.  Maybe there's a local ordinance.  The catalyst for this post though comes from the ""no kids"" policy.

&#x200B;

The ad was marked as ""not suitable for children,"" which I totally understand.  ""Not suitable,"" however, doesn't mean they can't set foot on the property as far as I'm aware (and I'm fairly certain the latter isn't even legal, but anyway...).  So no children will be staying there or 'using' the facilities, but we have family also in town who are staying off-site at a hotel, so we thought why not come over to the house we're renting instead?  We messaged the property manager (who claims to have messaged the owner) explaining there are relatives we'd like to join us for a couple of hours for Thanksgiving dinner and they have two children.  They won't be staying there overnight, etc., etc. and are simply coming over to eat with us.  They 'declined the offer' (their words) and reiterated to re-read the house rules (bear in mind I'm not properly conveying the clear and completely unnecessary sour attitude this person was expressing with us just for asking if we can have our relatives over for Thanksgiving dinner).

&#x200B;

So we write back, ""okay thanks"" so we can let the relatives know and come up with an alternate plan.  The person then immediately does a 180, writes back ""okay, what?"" Asks us if we're cancelling and just starts getting completely salty out of nowhere.  Someone in our party then called AirBnB to see if they could contact the owner and explain the situation because we were genuinely concerned with why this person is so upset with us seemingly out of nowhere and thought a mediator to intervene may help deescalate whatever was going on. Turns out AirBnB just called the property manager we were already speaking to.  This person is now \*livid\* we contacted customer service ""to get them in trouble"" (which we had no intention of doing nor was that ever our goal) and sending angry messages demanding we cancel our reservation and forfeit the deposit.

&#x200B;

Again, I know it's reasonable to assume there are multiple sides to a story here, but I really can't tell you how much our language contrasts with their complete lack of professionalism as we've been communicating with them.  I've stayed in multiple AirBnBs all over the world at this point and have never experienced anything even close to this.  We're all in our late 30s-mid-40s and they've been scolding us like we're children, telling us we ""messed up,"" ""never piss off the owner,"" ""let this be a lesson,"" and proclaiming they could never trust people like us in their house if the house rules (most of which weren't contained in the ad) are ""too difficult for you to understand,"" etc., and now ""if you show up you will be arrested.""  All of these, by the way, were contained in the same message and were completely unprovoked.  The person is acting certifiably nuts.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the rant.  We just received the worst of those messages from this person this morning and it really rubbed me the wrong way.  I was initially coming here to ask for advice but now I'm not sure what more we can do.  To make matters worse, it's a holiday week and this person waited until a few days before said holiday to send us this litany of demands and make everything uncomfortable, so now there are a limited number of properties still available and most are several times the cost we had locked in if anything is available at all.  Not sure what to do at this point, but the whole thing seems weird and might be a lost cause.

&#x200B;

**Update Edit:**

**Thanks for the input so far, everyone.  It ended up being escalated to a manager at AirBnB and the owner/manager canceled from their end.  AirBnB reviewed the exchanges between us and have apologized profusely for the way they were speaking to us (the person in charge of helping us take care of the issue said he was personally embarrassed by the things they were saying).

* I hosted two males via AirBnB rental in Edmonton, Alberta a few months ago (Easter long weekend - I was out of town to visit a sick relative).  
* The guests threw a party in my home, and trashed it, causing more than $10,000 of damage.  They put holes in the walls, smoked drugs in the unit, and left drugs and alcohol throughout.
* Based on witness reports, they may have sexually assaulted at least one female on my bed, leaving blood and bodily fluids everywhere.  There were used condoms strewn everywhere.
* Neighbours also witnessed them kicking two females out of the house, late one night/early one morning (3-4 AM) that weekend.  There was yelling and screaming, and they dragged them out of my unit by their hair.  There was women's jewelry and clumps of long hair throughout my home, and high heel marks/chips (from thrashing) on my wall and front door. 
* I came home (after a difficult weekend away - the relative ended up passing away) and reported the incident to AirBnB immediately.  They opened a file.  Not surprisingly, it has been a nightmare dealing with them (upwards of 100 hours of work total - phone, email, personal time sorting receipts, etc.).  Despite having provided evidence for more than $10,000 in damage, they offered me a $2,000 settlement.  I refused to sign that settlement (to try and push for a fairer settlement amount), and ultimately they ended up revoking any payout because I didn't sign by a certain date (because they wouldn't budge on their low-ball offer).  I have received $0.  
* It turns out these two are known to police as members of a gang.  There is now a police file associated with this case, and I have had to meet with police regarding the incident (what happened to the females).  The police visited my home to interview me and see the scene.

**Summary/Questions:**

* This has been a nightmare for me, and I want to share the story to warn others.
* I have contacted AirBnB several times since the final decision, however each time I get elevated after explaining the situation again, I am ultimately ignored.  I have been told my file is closed and they will not return my calls or emails.
* Where do I go from here?  I need the money (I have had to replace my bed and other furniture, repair my home, etc.), however I am concerned that if I hire a lawyer, I will end up owing money (even if I win) due to legal costs.

**TL;DR:**

Yesterday I found out that the Airbnb I was staying in for 6 out of 21 days was infested with bed bugs. Took ample pictures and gave them to Airbnb support. To their credit, they immediately paid and put me in a hotel for a week and are working on finding me alternative housing. 

Here's the catch though: I was sent an automatic email to review the bed bug Airbnb and upon doing so I noticed that the bed bug infested room was immediately put back online and available to reserve out immediately??!! 

I don't know Airbnb's policy for this nor does it affect me immediately but that's just not okay. I was renting out 1 of 5 rooms within the house, all of the others were Airbnb listings aswell. 

1. It's IMPOSSIBLE to get rid of bed bugs within 12 hours. The host didn't even live in the same state as the listing so make that doubley impossible. 

2. If one of the bedrooms had bed bugs that means it's very likely that they all had bed bugs and the whole house is a safety risk. I doubt Airbnb is going to find the other guest alternative housing aswell (I didn't notify any of them). 

3. How in the hell is the host ALLOWED to immediately relist this unit with no validation or consequences? I can't imagine a ""Oh yeah, we got rid of the bed bugs immediately"" message by the host would fly. 

Lastly, shout out to Airbnb support for recognizing the severity of the situation and handling it on my end, but what good is it to me if someone else has to go through the same pains. 

Tldr: My Airbnb bed was infested with bed bugs, Airbnb found me alternative housing, the listing that I was staying at was back online in less than 12 hours.

At 8PM or so, she had 2 more guests show up with out talking to me. I blew it off, b/c its her birthday. By 10PM she had at least 10 people there.  I messaged her again and told her that those extra guests need to leave by 11PM and no more than 4 guests after otherwise it would be $70 per extra guest regardless if they stayed the night or not. She said to not worry, b/c no one other than the 4 guests will be there. Around midnight all of them left.  


At 230AM, those same 10 people showed back up and it made me really want to drive to my house and demand everyone  to leave... but I decided that would probably be a bad idea. Looking at the security camera footage one of the guys rigged the door to stay open slightly so my automated lock would not lock. THIS REALLY SCARED ME.   


Regardless of what issues I had with the guest, I called her immediately to warn her and have her lock the door, which she did.

I was out when she booked and annoyingly, despite having setup Airbnb to send me text notifications, I didn't receive anything notifying me that there was a booking or that she had even sent me a message through Airbnb.

The guest sent me a text asking for the address for the listing she had just booked (it was sent via e-mail, but most guests don't think to check this for some reason).

I replied back with the address and, as I had no information about the booking, I asked what day she was checking in and how many guests there would be.

The guest told me that there would be three guests.

I have three bedrooms available, all of which contain a queen size bed, so I asked how many bedrooms needed to be prepared.

The guest told me that I would need to prepare all three bedrooms.

When I got back home I noticed that the booking was only for one guest, so I contacted the guest to let her know that there would be an extra charge for the additional guests. I also called Airbnb to let them know that they would have to amend the booking and contact the guest to sort out the payment.

After hearing that the extra guests would cost her money, she replied back telling me that the extra guests were not guests and were only visitors.

Clearly this is a lie as she wouldn't have asked me to prepare three bedrooms if she is the only one staying. I suspect that the guest is planning on turning up by herself and having the others arrive later to avoid paying for the extra guests. As she's a new user, she is probably expecting a private room to be an entire home. She has absolutely no chance of getting the extra guests in without me knowing.

This could be interesting, but it's more likely that it will turn into a cancellation and a complaint that she can't get a full refund.",0.93,53,1556797032.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/bjtwjy/sounds_like_a_guest_is_planning_on_sneaking_extra/,True,24

I get in touch with her to let her know I will talk to her mom in person once she has completed a profile. 

Here is mom at 11:20 AM : I am traveling alone, anticipate arriving later in the day on Saturday, May 18 and departing on Monday, May 20. So you are aware, I do have a number of allergies, so please don't worry about providing any items that may contain gluten, dairy, soy or allium in the room. I look forward to staying with you. 

Mom at 12:10 AMI read more about your space in the property profile and have both a question and a request.  What are you referring to, when you show 'light breakfast'? I don't believe I would have access to the house manual until I arrive.  You mention the sheets are microfiber - can you confirm this or if you have cotton sheets on the bed - which is much preferred. Also, is it possible to avoid using dryer sheets on the sheets. I have a reaction to synthetic fibers such as microfiber and don't deal well with chemicals found in dryer sheets.  Thanks for understanding! All the rest sounds great!

Mom at 12:17 PM : I found the house manual - thank you! I will provide my own breakfast - not to worry.

Mom at 12:40 PM : So sorry for all the messages!  The receipt shows that a payment of $88.06 was made today, with another one due on or before May 5. The total before the $20 credit applied is $176.12 however, the receipt shows the credit was added and not subtracted from the amount charged today. This is fine but then  the balance due should reflect $68.06 and not $88.06 as what shows in the email I received.  Can you confirm this please.

It locks behind you and even if you have a key you cannot get back in (I didn’t know this until later) we were doing laundry and walked out on the patio improperly dressed for the weather. We also had no water. 

I contact the host right away and they say they’re an hour away— they will let us know when they are close. Two hours go by with no update. They finally show up and tell us that the door is electric and a locksmith needs to fix it. We need to pay up 250€ to get in. I don’t have any money because I’m locked out. Plus, why should I have to pay? I ask how they knew it was 250 and they tell me it’s happened to guests before. 

I contact Airbnb for help to no avail. I spend the next six hours until my battery is dead trying to get help. The first person I talk to says they need to call the host and call me back. Then I get a message on the Airbnb app saying I need to pay the host 250€. Now when I call they keep trying to send me back to this person and they are not available. I just spend the whole time on the phone until the call fails. The cycle continues for hours and no one helps us. I hired my own locksmith to try and get us in. This was a nightmare because I can’t speak the language. He’s a really nice guy but cannot get us in after hours of trying. By midnight the host calls her locksmith and he opens the door within a minute. 

I have 28 more stays booked but I don’t want to do business with Airbnb ever again. I live at Airbnb’s most of the year but this whole thing was a nightmare. We’re now sick from exposure.

adae3408-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Host cancelled on us last minute penalty-free because she was ""uncomfortable"" hosting us.","We had booked a nice house in Lake Tahoe for a family vacation the week after Christmas. We booked back in April 2018, well ahead. Obviously Lake Tahoe is a highly desirable vacation area.

I booked the listing myself, and my mom (who also has a reputable AirBnB account) was messaging the host a few times asking questions about the listing. I had just had a baby in September and was letting my mom take over some of the planning of the trip.

The host pleasantly answered my mom's questions. Out of nowhere, she decided to cancel our reservation a week before we were supposed to check-in. She said she was ""uncomfortable"" with hosting us because my mom was messaging her. I read their transcript. Not once did she ask my mom to stop messaging her.

I watched our dates get re-listed and re-booked at a premium price. She obviously made a nice profit off of this situation.

We spent hours on the phone with AirBnB and the best they could do after MUCH prodding was $700 credit. This only covers a fraction of the cost we had to pay to find ourselves a replacement house in Lake Tahoe with similar features (number of bedrooms, dog friendly, etc).

We ended up paying an additional 1K on top of our original out-of-pocket expense.

I have learned that Instant Book listings can cancel at any time if they are ""uncomfortable"" at a maximum of 3 times per year without needing to provide any documentation or reasoning to AirBnB. My feeling is that the host knows this and took advantage of this loophole.

Needless to say this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth and I will have a hard time using AirBnB again. Before this, I had nothing but great experiences and used AirBnB for practically every vacation.

Has anyone gone through something similar?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT:**
Here is the chat transcript between the host and my mom. It was very hard to track down because the conversation is no longer in the app for my mom. My guess is that the host blocked her and AirBnB removes the chat when that happens? I have no idea. My mom has some of the transcript copied in email messages. It was very messy and I transcribed it the best I could:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Mom:**
Hi
We are looking forward to the trip! If it’s $175 a night how come the total is so much more? Pls advise. Thank you!

**Host:**
Hello [mom’s name], I don’t see you as having a reservation but you are looking at renting a house in Tahoe. Please let me know if otherwise. My home is cleaned after every use and you may find that I have the lowest cleaning fees out there at $175 to clean a 2200 square foot house.

I don’t know why airbnb adds on top of the fees I receive but I heard it can be up to 12%.

Lastly, everyone else’s prices fluctuate depending on demand so you may be looking at a weekend vs a weekday?

**Mom:**
Oh I think you have the res under my daughters name, [my name]. But anyway I was looking at the listing and it says about $175 a night to stay there and we are there for 7 days but the billing is around $350 a night or thereabouts. Just wondering if you charge double for after Christmas?

**Mom:**
The listing says $176 a night. Pls let me know.

**Host:**
Yes, Christmas time is very expensive. I haven’t raised my prices for Xmas since 2013 and it always goes. New Years eve and July 1st are the most expensive days — $500 a night. Airbnb uses algorithm’s based on supply and demand which often say I should price it higher but I don’t do it. The other days around I price at $400 a day or $370 which is the same as what I put for a weekend night during the winter. I have an automatic discount based on the number of days you book too. I think it is set at 15% if you book a week.

I am not sure how Airbnb’s webpage is written. I just looked at my calendar and can see that any of the remaining days that I have available in December are $175. I don’t price less than $150 a night.

If you are seeing $175 I think that is based on the date that you are searching for.

**Mom:**
Ok. My mistake.

**Host:**
No worries. Let me know if you want to cancel and there won’t be any charges at all. You booked so early, I didn’t even have a chance to put my prices up. I looked at my reservation and it has $251 a night plus $175 cleaning. I seem to remember your daughter was having a baby and was unsure if she was going to stay but smart booking it ahead.

**Mom:**
We are looking forward to family time. All is good. I am [my name]'s mom so you can see my reviews on Airbnb too. She booked it for us because we were busy selling our home. We are full time RVers now (yikes) so it’s been really crazy and so much going on in just a few months. It will be me, my husband, [my name] and husband and baby and my son [brother’s name] and his girlfriend.

**Mom:**
Do you have a big pot for making chili and spaghetti [rest of message lost, we can’t find it. Some questions about coffee pot, and asking about insider info on ski lift tickets]

**Host:**
Hello [mom’s name],

Yes I have a pot for spaghetti. Please check the amenities section of the site for my coffee machines. I do have 5 but I do not have one that is a drip machine. Similar information is there for close ski resorts — Northstar and I think the lift passes are in the $150 range. I can send you my home manual if you cannot see it on Airbnb

**Mom:**
Yes I read more details and thought I saw a coffee pot. We don’t use pods. So I should bring one with a water kettle? We are all big on coffee. How close is Safeway?

**END OF THREAD**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am also going to provide the thread between myself and the host because I think that context is helpful:

**Me:**
Hello [host name]! My husband and I are having our first baby this summer and we are wanting to take a vacation in December with my parents and brother (and brother's girlfriend). We would have two small, well-behaved dogs in our group. We are very committed to following the rules during our stay.

I wanted to confirm my understanding of your cancellation policy. If, for some reason, we decide sometime in November/December that we can't travel with a newborn, we would like to be able to cancel for a full refund. It seemed like we could get a full refund as long as we cancelled 14 days before our trip. Is that correct?

**Host:**
Hello [my name],  You sound like a lovely group.  Yes, I can definitely give you a full refund 14 days before.  I hope your baby is easy like mine was. 

**Me:**
Perfect, thank you! Yes, we are definitely hopeful that our baby is easy! Can't wait our trip. Have a great summer!

**Host:**
Hello [my name], I think I've been emailing with your mom.  If you have any hesitations about the trip, I will be fine if you want to cancel and I won't charge you anything at all.  

**Host:**
[my name], [mom's name] continues to contact me and I have become uncomfortable with this rental as there appears to be little understanding of Airbnb (I booked with you) or respect for my time.  I had asked that you be the contact person.

**Me:**
Hello, I am sorry to hear that. I am not totally familiar with the communication between you two but I will follow up with my mom.

adae38d6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,As a host: Why I'm not a fan of guests my age and older,"I've noticed a pattern amongst the hundreds of guests I've hosted over the last 3 years I've been renting private rooms in my home through Airbnb. Now, every time I get a booking request from someone middle-aged or of retirement age, I cringe - I don't want to not book to this demographic, but these guests almost always give me a punch in my ratings.

The pattern looks like this: super sweet and adventurous people out for an explore to a new city. They arrive and they are excited to meet me and see their room. Within a day, I begin to get complaints that surprise me (eg.'you don't have any bodywash here for me? Only soap?') and small behaviours that push boundaries (eg. claiming the guest lounge as their personal space despite my having said it is a shared space).

Then after a friendly goodbye, I get a review that not only gives me poor ratings, it gives me tons of 'advice' that amounts to a to-do list for how to make my house more appealing. I've been told I should replace the original 1940s sink in the bathroom, buy a rug for the large living room because they didn't like my carpet... and on and on.

While I do get occasional not so awesome ratings and reviews from all-age travellers, they tend to reflect true things that need attention: maybe the bathroom didn't get cleaned up to snuff that time, or the kitchen was used by my kids and I hadn't had time to clean it up. I am ok with those things, that is on me and makes sense.

My gut tells me that this age-range is used to the hotel life, and that that's what they really want. But hotels in Vancouver are insane, so they go with Airbnb because it fits their budget. ...unfortunately, they still WANT a hotel experience; and I end up with the reviews that reflect their disappointed expectations.

And hey, I have definitely also had stellar guests of older ages. And grumpy guests of younger ages. So this isn't an across-the-bar thing, but it is a pattern.

Have other hosts out there experienced the same things? ",0.92,58,1499010627.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/6ktwp8/as_a_host_why_im_not_a_fan_of_guests_my_age_and/,True,38

Of course you can always decline, but then guests will get angry at you for not accepting and now you're the bad guy for ""forcing"" them to cancel instead, and now you're left with a 1 star review, or you have to play the guessing game and guess whether they are genuinely altering their reservation or simply gaming the system. I've had all of these scenarios happen to me 6 times this year alone. Simple fix is just apply the same cancellation penalties to alterations.

Wants to charge extra fee. We told her no because the request is crazy.","A while ago, my friend and I stayed at an airbnb. After check out, we later received a message from the Airbnb host saying that her cleaner was at the apartment and said we were the “worst guests ever.” Said we left garbage everywhere, dishes left out, surprised by the mess. She said her cleaner is charging extra time for cleaning, and she would charge us the cleaner’s extra fee about $20.

We were shocked by her accusation and asked for more info. These are our sins:
* Cleaner said we left the dishes out. True, but we had washed the plates before we left and laid them out to dry next to the sink. They were not dirty, just wet. Somehow, the cleaner mistakenly thought they were dirty or maybe expected us to dry them and put them back in the cabinet. 

* Cleaner said we left garbage everywhere. Untrue. We had combined all our trash into one giant trash bag in the kitchen for the cleaner to see. Our sin was that had not taken out the trash in the Building Trash Receptacle Room

* Cleaner said the bathroom was stained. We asked for photos. The cleaner took a photo that showed a bathroom floor with some hairs on the floor and a towel on the floor (we put it out for when we stepped out of shower). 

The airbnb host said her rule was that we leave the house as tidy and clean as when we arrived. And we had violated that rule with the dishes, trash, and bathroom situation.

I read the rules again. We were paying a cleaning fee. Nowhere does it say we were supposed to take out the trash. 

I told her that her and the cleaner’s request did not make sense, and we would not be paying extra cleaning fee.

Am I crazy for thinking the host is being crazy? 
* I don’t see how how we left the place is anywhere near the level of ‘worst guests ever’. Our dishes were left clean. Her rules never told us to take out the trash and we had in fact already thought we were being responsible by putting everything in one specific trash bag for the cleaner to see. The condition we left the house (hairs on wet bathroom floor) and wet clean dishes not dried and stored — these all seem like normal level things that should be covered under a cleaning fee. We didn’t do anything extra weird that warranted an extra cleaning fee. 

* additionally, her instructions that her apartment should have been left as ‘clean as when we arrived’ seem unclear, especially since we were already paying a cleaning fee. Did she want us to mop the bathroom floors? What exactly did the cleaning fee cover then? I told her if she had expectations we were to take out the trash and other specific things, she should have clearly written these out all in the Airbnb listing. 

It also seems very weird for a host to be having rules that a house be left as tidy and clean as it was,  when there’s a cleaning fee, and when people are vacationing...how do you expect a house to be in the same condition it was in upon arrival?

Thanks for your opinions.

Listed as entire home, but even the description says the bathroom and shower are shared and other residents live in the house on the second floor, and everyone uses the same front door. This is a private room in a shared home.

It seems that in Europe and perhaps other regions hosts are either confused as to what the categories mean, or are intentionally picking the wrong category because they'll get more bookings.

I'm of the opinion that ""entire home"" means that the entire home is yours for the time you rent, and nobody else can enter the property listed, including the common areas, besides the renters. Nothing is shared with anyone else. You should be able to walk from the front door to your bedroom and everywhere in between butt naked and shouldn't have to worry about running into anyone. The host shouldn't be there ever unless there's some issue and they gave notice.

I wish I was asking for clarification but I'm not mistaken, the definition I'm using is clearly the correct one, and some hosts are abusing the system for profit. Apparently Airbnb USA is slightly more on top of this problem but the EU is a total shitshow at this point.

Woke up at 5:30 to see they had messaged me numerous times from around 3am stating they had lost the keys and were locked out, they were also very drunk and it was hard to understand but the general gist was one set was left in the apartment, the other set was lost in the club.

I messaged as soon as I woke up and offered to come down, apologised for not answering their messages etc. They said not to worry as they called a locksmith. I thought that was it, the locksmith let them in. I'll just get another key copy made. 

They messaged again stating the locksmith couldn't get in, so they decided to change the locks completely. This all happened during the middle of the night/morning. They paid for the charge. But now I have to get all new sets of keys made, as well as ensure the lock is as good as the one I had. 

Do I bill them for the key copies I need? I need at least three new keys (total of 5, 3 for the new apartment door and 2 for the side door key attached). Is there anything else I need to do? ",0.94,52,1550919797.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/atuds4/guest_lost_both_set_of_keys_had_the_locks_changed/,True,48

adae4902-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Beware this Bed Bug Scam,"I rent a room in my NYC apartment and just had two seemingly friendly low key guests staying with me for the last two nights.

The night after they left, they sent me a message saying everything was great, their only complaint was that they found an ""insect"" on their bed and we should check more thoroughly.

And they sent an image of this insect that they found, clearly on a mattress.

They **did not** ask for any money back or even seem particularly worried about the insect. **But** the image was very obviously of a bed bug.

On seeing this I immediately freaked out, my first assumption wasn't that they were lying but that I had bed bugs and would need to take immediate action to deal with it. As I'm in the middle of working through an intense class, on a limited timetable this was the last thing I needed.

Now here's where their story started to rapidly fall apart.

I immediately went to the room and stripped the bed and began an inspection of the mattress, and immediately noticed that the pattern in the image they sent me was nothing like my mattress.

In their image there was a raised, floral pattern on the mattress, on mine, there was a depressed swirling / y shaped pattern, completely distinct from each other. My mattress also has a speckled/dotted texture which wasn't in the picture they showed. I also examined my mattress protectors which were without any pattern.

Quickly realizing that something was up I also recalled that the guests **had not** stripped the bed before they left, so did they take off the sheets, and mattress protector, find a bug, take a picture, and then re-make it? 

Further none of the sheets or pillows were white (the bedding/mattress in their picture was white). The bed I'd made for them had purple pillow covers, a grey fitted sheet, and a black and white checkered comforter/comforter cover. 

After realizing what was going on I called AirBnB immediately wanting to get ahead of them if they intended to make any claims. I explained the situation to the representative and asked them to open up a case file, I then sent the image the guests sent me as well as a set of images of my bed, box spring, and mattress protector.

I also responded to the guest with these images asking them exactly what was going on, and where these photos were taken.

So be aware, guests are aware that bed-bugs are a major concern for anyone hosting large numbers of travelers. It's something that many hosts are already concerned about. And it is known that AirBnB responds harshly in scenarios where bed bugs are suspected and demands hosts enact pest control and provide proofs that infestations have been cleared. 

These guests didn't even ask for money, they just sent an image and basically played dumb. But I feel certain that their goal was to get a refund from us so that they would keep quiet.

Some people are unfortunately assholes and willing to cause a lot of stress to others to save themselves less than $150.00.",0.97,55,1523974475.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8cwtwi/beware_this_bed_bug_scam/,True,35

The listing did not mention any pets at all or have pets in the picture, but when we arrived there were 2 cats. It was kind of crappy because one of the people in our group is allergic but it wasn’t worth making a fuss over. He popped a Benadryl and we didn’t think much of it. 

Then we go to settle in and realize the welcome packet of info had 2 pages of information on how to care for the cats. It said that guests were expected to make sure the cats’ water and food bowls were well stocked at all times. We also had to give them treats around 10pm in the basement so they’d go to bed and let them out of the basement at 7am because that’s their typical routine. They also asked us to change the litter box every 2 days. 

There were also a ton of plants in the house (over 50 different succulents, orchids, herb plants, and what not) that we had to water daily which was a bit frustrating because I know nothing about houseplants and they didn’t say how much water the plants needed, but warned overwatering would kill the plants. I don’t think I would have minded it if the plants weren’t scattered across 4 stories and in every corner of the house. 

I’ve never stayed in an AirBnB where the owners had pets stay in the house with us when the owners themselves were not there. I’m not upset but was just wondering if this is common practice?

I was then directed to an error page, saying that Airbnb will review my account, and the Trust and Safety team will e-mail me soon. The next morning, I was sent the following e-mail:

&#x200B;

I did not reach out whatsoever. I had just attempted to log in to my account, for the first time in two years. I have called their customer service number to no avail. I'm just told ""we see you have an account, but I can't access it, and if Trust and Safety sent that message, we are not able to help you. Their decisions are final."" They apologize, and even admit it makes absolutely no sense. I asked to be transferred to Trust and Safety, but apparently they are only reachable via e-mail. I've sent many messages in response, detailing that I am a tax-paying, law abiding, full time working human with no derogatory marks against my account, and no criminal record. I've practically begged them for help or at least an explanation, saying I'll take whatever security measures necessary to redeem my account. No answer. I messaged them on facebook explaining my issue, and all they've said is: ""Hi \*\*\*\*\*\*, we’re sorry for any inconvenience. For account security purposes, we’ll need to verify your information again. Can you reply here with your email address, phone number, and full name on your profile so we can authenticate your account and follow-up?"" (which I've answered, with my information, twice now) - and - ""We appreciate your continued support with Airbnb, \*\*\*\*\*. Rest assured your case is with our specialised team now, and your Case Manager will do their best to help you. Thank you once again for your patience"" (which I've been told twice now, over the course of 5 days).

&#x200B;

I have a good friend who had a similar issue. Her account was banned without explanation; she has no criminal record, all 5 star reviews, and no derogatory marks. She said that upon trying to log in to her mother's airbnb account on her computer, she got the same error message, and shortly after her mother's account was banned. She made the mistake of trying again with her father's account on her computer, and he was banned for life as well.

&#x200B;

The only possible explanation I've theorized: 3 years ago I was abroad in Australia. I stayed at an airbnb with some friends. While I slept, they drank and broke a vinegar bottle and one wine glass. We settled everything through Airbnb, they paid her $400 AUD, and she told me she would not leave me a negative review as she knew it was not my fault. I have also stayed in multiple Airbnb's since this occasion; so banning me 3 years later after multiple 5 star reviewed stays, and a completely financially settled case that left me with nothing but a good review, makes little to no sense to me.

&#x200B;

My mother is a super host with Airbnb, and is hell bent on trying to solve this as she sees the outright nonsense of the situation as well. Via my research, it seems to be a somewhat common and inexplicable occurrence. At most, I've read that someone who has connections to someone else with a criminal record, has been banned for life. I've also read that this happened to people with multiple accounts. Neither of these situations apply to me whatsoever. What is going on here?! Has anyone else experienced this?

\*\*(If it helps at all, I was the victim of identity theft when I was 16 years old. From what I understand, that has been completely resolved)\*\*

Any help, advice, or similar experiences shared would be so very helpful. I'm at a loss, and pretty bummed that I no longer can use this site to book a spot to stay in when I visit my terminally ill grandmother next month. Thank you guys!

UPDATE:   


I have called customer service so many times now. Same answer each time. When I message them on facebook, they ask for my e-mail, phone number, and name. Over and over again. I finally commented my story on their facebook page, posting it on two of their recently uploaded photos.

Then... THEY BLOCKED ME FROM COMMENTING, CONTACTING THEM, AND DELETED MY COMMENTS (on facebook).

I've made a twitter account.. I don't really know how to use it yet but here is my account page: [https://twitter.com/cheeseandpsych/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/cheeseandpsych/with_replies)

Hopefully that shows up for you guys. Please spread the word and retweet if you're in the mood.

I feel absolutely powerless and overtaken. I don't know what to do, but it seems as I should give up. This is a complete scam, and entirely unjust. Customer service is nonexistent based on how much they've ""helped"" me. Lastly, please take a moment to read through the top voted comments on their posts on facebook. Hundreds of other people have had the same experience I did, and many more have experienced far worse. They reply by asking for people's information, saying they'll get back to them. They never do. If you complain further like I did, you'll get blocked even on their facebook.

Do not trust your time and money with Airbnb...

They were in town for a music festival and I work 9-10 hours a day during the week, so our paths rarely crossed during their stay. I was up early, they came back late, etc. 

Here's the kicker, apparently they found my communication to be SO bad that they left me 1-star ratings across the board  (except 5-star on location for some reason).  They wrote things in the private feedback about how they thought I was ""cold"" except I maybe saw them twice during their entire 6-day stay and they just went straight up to their room.

One guest said they want to violate the over occupancy agreement and don't like the outdoor camera. This things are posted in the listing but Airbnb sided with them (just to be fair they said).",0.81,49,1562374601.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/c9nlen/want_to_host_maybe_not_see_this_first/,True,50
adae6ec8-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Nightmare Edition: What an unregulated AirBnB might look like...,"My wife and I live in New York City, what I would guess is the most regulated AirBnB market in the country.  Before this past weekend, we've been somewhat ambivalent toward these rules and regulations.  I get why they're here, especially given the lack of reasonably priced quality housing in the city, but it's definitely intense.  Let me also say before getting into our experience, that we've had many good and a few really great experiences with AirBnB in the past, and we don't plan to stop using the service.  

Well, this past weekend, we got a taste of what a totally unregulated AirBnB market might look like, and it wasn't pretty.  We took a trip to Memphis for our wedding anniversary, and booked what looked like a lovely two-bedroom spot in the downtown area for three nights.  Our total with fees was around $370.  

Around a week before our trip, my wife wanted to get in touch with the host for check-in procedures.  She checked the listing to get a contact, and there were some new, extremely negative reviews on the page.  These reviews talked about cleanliness, roaches, and general disrepair of the apartment.  My wife got in touch with host and asked if the issues had been resolved.  The host said all was fine.  And we suspected that complaining to AirBnB before actually checking out a place would probably not work out.  So, we figured we'd give it a shot and see what happens.  

We arrived in Memphis pretty late, and caught a taxi that brought us to the building at about 10:30pm on Friday night.  This building, which I think is called the Exchange Building, on North 2nd Street, is a modern day flophouse.  There's an iPad based facial recognition check-in station on the ground floor.  (Very nice) check in agents hand you a plastic trash bag of towels and a key.  And then you go to your apartment.  

But it was definitely NOT the apartment that was photographed and listed online.  Lighting fixtures were different (and less functional), the apartment's configuration was reversed, and the furniture had worn-through upholstery.  Elsewhere, lighting fixtures were broken, a (13th floor) window was covered with plywood and falling apart insulating tape, and a smoke detector was missing.  Vents were covered with years of dust and grime.  Toilets were not cleaned.  Bedsheets were not changed.  And O, Sweet Jesus, did it smell.  

We called AirBnB, and over the course of the weekend, we fought our way to a refund and having them cover the cost of our first night in a hotel.  The first case manager, who was great, promised us that the company would cover this.  Getting others to follow through on that promise took multiple angry calls and emails, and AirBnB transferred us multiple times to new case managers, some of whom stuck to scripts and refused to refund us the full amount.  Eventually, we found someone willing to go back to the original audio conversation we had in which the first manager told us to ""go ahead and book"" the hotel.  So I guess it all worked out in the end.  
 
But man, this building must be the fake shitty hotel nightmare that most cities want to avoid like the plague.  We mentioned this place to one of our Lyft drivers during our trip, and he said the building is pretty infamous at the moment.  

I did a quick search for this building in the sub--no hits.  I'm really curious to hear if anyone else has experienced this building, or anything like it, in their experiences.",0.88,54,1562290771.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/c9a9nh/nightmare_edition_what_an_unregulated_airbnb/,True,49
adae7030-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Host did not disclose child,"Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, but I recently arrived at my Airbnb on the night of the 13th. I booked this place for a month, and the night I arrived, the host showed me around. He was really nice, and I appreciate him allowing me into his home. 

I however first noticed once I was inside there were kid's shoes, and I looked up and saw a living room covered in kid's toys. While he was giving me a house tour, I noticed there is a kid's toothbrush and toothpaste in the bathroom. I don't dislike kids, but his Airbnb listing he had included that the room was in a ""quiet and safe"" neighborhood. Kids are cute, but I was not aware there would be a toddler in the house. I also wouldn't be bothered if the house was to stay quiet......

I asked him after seeing all the kid's stuff if there was a kid in the house. He said no. I found that a bit strange, but I decided not to question it. It's none of my business. I don't care as long as it doesn't disturb me. 

I believe some time Saturday, I wake up to a child screaming for her dad. I hear Frozen songs blasting throughout the house. She cries and screams, and I just try to leave the house to avoid it. I think maybe by night she won't be there. That night, there's more crying and screaming. This morning, I woke up to crying and screaming. I didn't think this would be an issue, and I really don't dislike kids...I just was not expecting this.

I'm not sure what I can do about this, but I feel stuck. I feel annoyed and frustrated. I don't feel like a host has to explicitly state that there is a child, but I would've found another place if I knew there would be a toddler disrupting my sleep or would be screaming while I was in my room trying to get work done. Maybe his expectation was that I wouldn't be around as much since I booked it for a month, but I'm confused as to the course of action I can take going forward....",0.91,51,1550455907.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/ars07m/host_did_not_disclose_child/,True,26

adae731e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,0550hrs and I'm wide awake.,"Just venting.

SuperHost with 120+ 5 star reviews.
Got an instabook from a local who had 1 previous (5 star, wonderful) review. The picture is of 5 college age guys, so we didn't really know who was who. I know I know..red flags out the wazoo.

In response to our auto-ask questions when booking, ""what brings you to town?"", ""who will accompanying you?"", their abbreviated  response: ""Business. Family friend""...short, terse, ultra-red flags engaged.

Unfortunately we are generally pretty easy going and recognize that it takes all kinds (plus we had been day drinking all morning and in very accommodating moods), so we kind of just recognize that while things are weird, we've been pleasantly surprised before.

Nope.

They show up and the first thing that hits me is that they look like drug addicts...something was off, especially since they didn't have any bags with them. I was talking to some friends who had just dropped us off, so my SO handled the meet and great, show you around stuff. Her response once they were settled was ""they're weird""...ugh.

Well, they leave soon after and are gone for a few hours. It's around 10pm that they show back up and all is well for an hour or so...from there on out, all night they are going from their room and outside to their car for 15 minutes at a time. Mind you, the car is parked out front so all of my neighbors are able to enjoy watching them do whatever it is that they're up to. All I can see from the window is them in the car, flashing their cell phone flashlight everywhere and sparking a lighter over and over again. I don't  know what's up, but it's annoying, disruptive and most likely illegal. Hell, if it was just weed I could really care less; just smoke your bowl and go to sleep...but nope, every hour or so they are taking extended car visits; 1130, 1230, 130, 230, 330...over and over again.

Now, you're probably asking why we didn't just call Airbnb and just kick them out? well to be honest, I was the only one awake as my SO slept through the events and, well, we need the money...additionally, it is 330 in the morning, so I'm figuring the end is near...

I decide though to try and limit the potential for cops showing up in front of my house with red and blue lights for a ""suspicious persons"" call and message our guests that a neighbor had texted wondering who was in the car in front of my house shining lights all over the place. I informed them that they need to stop making trips to their car during quiet hours or consider checking out early...

I'd like to say that them coming inside was preferable, but instead of going outside they just made quarter-hour visits to the bathroom to do whatever the hell they were up to.

Finally, around 6am I thought I heard them going through our closet so I poked my head out to find them packed up and leaving. They were obviously on something as they were slow moving, slurring their speech and not good at anything related to a motor function.

Whatever, at least they're gone.

Oh, yea, they definetly smoked cigarettes in the room, smoked weed in the bathroom and were kind enough to leave iv drug paraphernalia in the room for us to clean up...figured as much.

And that, friends, is why you always trust your gut and send people packing at the first hint of suspicion.

0630hrs, been awake all night and i can't even make coffee because I don't want to wake up the SO. Ugh. Woe is me.

adae7990-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Long time Superhost is about to break. Two illogical one star reviews within the span of a month from a property that consistently got 5 star reviews. Very long story... looking for advice on how to move forward.,"**Background of the Host and the property in question:**

My mother (M for short) has been doing Airbnb since the early days that the site first existed. She has always been savvy at trying to find ways to make extra money and she found out about Airbnb before it got extremely popular as it is today. She has gotten a few of her friends to start Airbnbing their properties due to her success and she has started to transition management of these rentals to me, her eldest son.

M has been a superhost for years now and this week is the first time I have ever seen her in such despair over her recent bookings. She owns multiple properties throughout the US garnering a consistent 5 star rating on all of the units she owns and she knows all the nuances about succeeding on Airbnb. Unfortunately, a waterfront property (LH for short) has become an anomaly within the very stable business she is running.

Unfortunately, M and I could not logically figure out why LH is suddenly getting **atrocious 1 star reviews**. LH would consistently be 5 star rated and the property is by all means well maintained, clean, and the locale is beautiful. Price comparisons with the other rentals and hotels in the area always shows that our property is a great bargain for what you get. The apartment has 3 bedrooms with 2 queen sized beds, full kitchen, 2 bathrooms, central A/C, cable TV, wifi, and all the other basic amenities that any normal house would have. 

The property that is advertised as LH on Airbnb is a house that contains two apartments, the bottom floor being the Airbnb rental, and the top floor being my apartment from which I help keep an eye on how things are going with the renters and can help anyone with any issues that arise. I have only recently moved into the owner apartment a few months ago and generally keep to myself unless anything is needed from our guests (this will be relevant later). 

The pros are all the amenities I mentioned, the privacy of a **whole apartment to the guest**, and the serene locality of the lake that is only a few steps away from the screen door and patio outside. 

The cons are a dated decor (that is still clean, circa 80s) and the weak cellphone reception near the lake.

----------------

**The events that have played out in quick succession which burnt out my Mother (M):**

A month ago we had a guest who had no prior reviews but was obviously from a wealthy background (codename L). She stayed at the apartment for a few days and did not contact M or I about any issues that she was having with her stay. Upon viewing her review, she gave 1 star reviews across the board. She complained about decor even though the photos on the site were accurate down to the placement of the furniture (yes we are meticulous). She also complained about **towels** even though there was a whole closet of them and even more reserve towels down the hall incase more were needed. Again. 1 star reviewed across the board by this 65 year old baby boomer from the yacht club. Since M is polite in her response to reviews, she told L about the honesty of her ad and that the towels that were missing were in a closet within her apartment but she never bothered to notify M or ask any questions. M lost her Superhost status over this review.

The review L placed caused an avalanche of problems for the rental property after that. All booked guests messaged M about towels and began harassing her over the fact that they thought there were no towels. M tried her best to calm all incoming guests and offered them refunds and rebookings if they had any doubts. No one decided to get a refund or cancel their booking (yet).

Within a week after L slammed us with her 1 star review, we had another older baby boomer couple come stay at the apartment... They had come from the South and the gentleman seemed kind enough to me and any requests he made I said yes to because I needed to get a good review from him. His wife was very very mean to me when I introduced myself to her and refused to say a word to me in favor of calling her husband to talk to me instead. The first interaction with her clued me to the fact that she had some problem with me or my appearance or something about me, but I brushed it off when the husband was cordial with me. This couple **extended their stay 2 extra days**, and the only issue they had was that the dock was not in deep enough water for their boat because the lake water level has been lower this year. Basically things that we as hosts could not be responsible for. Want to guess what review was given? **1 star reviews across the board**. The review was one sentence: ""I would not recommend this place to anyone"".

That very day the second 1 star review was placed another guest around 40 years old had arrived and **did not stay at the apartment for more than 1 hour.** She demanded a refund and said ""you should not advertise this as an apartment, you should advertise this as a **camp**"" and that ""My cellphone signals are terrible here"". M was in complete shock and horror had a meltdown. She refunded the guest and even **paid the guest the difference that Airbnb took as payment** to shut her up. She told the refunded guest to not leave any reviews because at this point it would break the property rental. To this day I don't know what planet that 40 year old came from because no ""camp"" I have ever been to has had A/C, wifi, free parking, and a whole damn house worth of appliances.

Another guest (Needy) which was slated to come within a week had already been harassing M about towels and doubted the ad for LH. Needy later mentioned to M during discussions that **she is a friend of L** and that L had a terrible time and she doesn't want to have the same experience. M after getting 3 terrible experiences back to back, M decided to cancel her first guest in all of her time in Airbnb... **Needy was cancelled a week before her planned stay.** Needy proceeded to yell and berate my Mother over the cancellation and said things like ""you have no right, blah blah"". But M could not handle it anymore... She could not risk another 1 star review from someone who she and I knew would likely leave **another 1 star review** since she was personal friends of L, the monster who started all of this.

----------------------

**The conclusions M and I have drawn**

Airbnb is changing fast and I think a lot of veteran users are getting lost in the shuffle. The influx of new users who **have zero idea how the rating system works** are now flooding the platform and causing massive issues for Hosts. With an influx of new and ignorant users, there has likely been an influx of users from a crowd which frankly M and I realized will never allow us to get 5 star reviews (as long as I live at the property that is).

*What I am about to say may be controversial, but its an honest observation from M who later on shared her thoughts with me...*

Airbnb has unfortunately zero ways to quantify or determine racist/bigoted reviews or reviews made in bad faith. *Gasp!* How could I go there? M is my mom afterall right? Wouldn't racists/bigots opt for properties owned by people they ""identify"" with? Let me explain...

My mom is white, born and raised as an American. I am a mixed child of Pakistani and American descent. My mom has a very pretty caucasian name that has nothing ""sinister"" about it. I on the other hand have a Muslim name that is one of the most common Muslim names in the world. Since M is the account manager for Airbnb, renters see her name and face as the representative of the properties, I assume that these guests assume they will be dealing with only white people. 

So... when I show up saying ""Hey! My name is [insert stereotypical terrorist name], please let me know if you need anything!"" it probably shocked them and maybe pissed them off. I know for a fact that the 2nd couple made me repeat my name twice and they had a hard time processing that I was my Mothers child.

I had my doubts about racism but I didn't want to voice it to M... afterall, she has seen me get bullied for being different as a young child and I saw what that did to her. Until M came to me, I was blaming myself for doing something to the property and jeopardizing my M's 5 star record. The only reason why I found out that my suspicions about racism/bigotry were true was because M came to me after cancelling Needy and told me she found a book left behind by the second boomer couple who left 1 star reviews. 

The book was a Christian conversion book.

M told me that while my intention and service is good, the location where we rent is primarily conservative white Christians, and based on these reviews it seems like **I am the problem.** I still help manage the property and clean and maintain things, but from now on I have to pretend I am a ghost.

I can't say if I will continue doing Airbnb if M ceases to be the face of the business. If my face and name is such a problem to some that they need to hurt me by giving me one stars, then I will either go to a different rental platform which can protect hosts from malicious reviews or convert the property to a private long-term rental. I feel helpless in all of this and I feel like its my fault for ruining M's Superhost status. I have begun looking into long term solutions to this problem and have no issue with moving to another site which would allow for more accountability against bad players who leave inaccurate reviews.

Anyways, thanks for listening and I hope that no other hosts here have had similar experiences with guests.",0.89,54,1532813654.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/92pnl4/long_time_superhost_is_about_to_break_two/,True,68

They were quite pleasant and although I didn’t ask, they made sure I understood they were a same sex couple. I told them that was fine and I had no problem at all with that and we had a short conversation about why they are very open about their relationship status (apparently there are some less progressive hosts who aren’t keen on having same sex couples around their kids... seriously, it’s 2018 but to each his own, I guess).   
You can hit a 5-iron to the beach from my front door but I almost always offer to walk down to the beach with my guests so I can point out the public restrooms on the beach and make sure they are aware of the safety flags and what the colors mean. They were in and out Friday night and Saturday morning/afternoon and seemed to be having a great time.  
I am normally off on Saturday and Sunday but had a project go sideways at the last minute and called to tell them I would be late getting home and to please call if they needed anything. About 11:00 last night (Saturday night), my neighbor calls and says he hears yelling and banging from my place. I get home to find them extremely drunk, yelling at each other and threatening to call the cops on each other. The cops show up, take a statement from me and take them outside. About an hour later, he knocks on the door, suggests I put their stuff outside and returns to continue refereeing between them. I dozed off but woke up about 4:00 AM to find their stuff gone, their shared vehicle gone and no sign of anyone. 

TL:DR?  

Drunk guests had a domestic dispute and the cops disappeared them and their car/clothes in the middle of the night.

I just spent a month in Europe (Spain and Holland) and rented about 8 Airbnb’s. 

There are two things that drove me nuts in every last one of them (and a bonus rant!) 

1. was the lack of explanations or labels for the trash systems.

Every community has its own system for recycling (or not) and every property has its own special trash system with cute colors or separators or bins sitting side by side. 

None of this means a fucking thing to me and it’s just wild guessing. 

Where does paper go? Is one for glass? Where does food waste go? Which plastics are ok? Do I have to compost? What about aluminum? There’s only 4 bins and I have more than 4 categories WHAT DO I DO?

Don’t get me wrong, I love some environmental effort and I will gladly abide and maintain any efforts for recycling. Please JUST LABEL THE BINS! 

I don’t want to reference the house manual to throw out a soda can. But doubtful that this is even covered in the manual. Everyone forgets. 

2. For gods sake- please tell me what kind of coffee maker you have in the kitchen. 

Photos can change if something breaks or you change systems. Please list it in the amenities on what is provided and what to bring.. 

Most places will provide a bit of coffee and that’s awesome, but my partner and I LOVE coffee and will each take 3-4 cups in the mornings. We will happily bring extra pods or capsules or press or filter ground coffee, but it’s like Russian roulette out there. Especially when you’re traveling around from Place to place. 

And fuck off if you have a SENSEO machine in a town that doesn’t sell SENSEO pods. 

Bonus rant- (and this only happened once in Spain) if  You CANT DRINK THE WATER, then at least 

1. Tell your guests in the listings. 
And 
2. provide your guests with some bottled water upon arrival. 

Especially when it’s a freaking heatwave and your check in time is during goddamn siesta and everything is closed.  

As I said- I am also a host, and I always cover these issues with my guests.. it’s crazy that it’s not common sense.

(AirBnb Fault!),"So to start off, I had commented this on a thread and it seemed to have many shocked replies from hosts, so I thought I would post it here so maybe more hosts would realize since so many hosts complain about guests giving 4 stars....

I have never been a host but I do use Air Bnb quite a bit. What happens when guests go to rate the place for the Overall stars (at least the ones I've stayed at, only in Canada) is as you browse your mouse over each star it explains them. I cant remember exactly the words but it basically states 1 star = poor , 2 star = fair, 3 star = good AS EXPECTED , 4 star = I can't remember but something like great, 5 star - EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS. 

I read this forum a lot so I always choose 5 star even if things are a little off (even once when there when cleaning was questionable). However, if I had never read any of these posts before I would have probably selected 3 star ""as expected"" instead of 5 star ""exceeding expectations"". For me, exceeding expectations should only be used if a host goes above and beyond, doing something extra special to make my stay amazing. Even with a beautiful and clean house I think guests could be confused at what to rate it as technically 3 stars says ""as expected"" !! You would be expecting a beautiful and clean house due to the listing, pictures , etc so why would this ""exceed your expectations""? 

&#x200B;

I just thought maybe more hosts should realize this as I see SO many complains saying guests ""don't understand that less than 5 stars is a fail"" and are awful for leaving them four stars. Air Bnb is the one making the guests think a 3 star is okay!  Maybe if hosts started sending a small blurb about this in the welcome or leaving message then guests would realize just how much a 3 or 4 star effects the host , as I am sure barely any guests frequent this reddit as much as I do.",0.93,51,1559842776.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/bxjkng/why_guests_are_always_leaving_you_4_star_reviews/,True,37

By the way, they ate a few of the chocolates but didn't touch the bottle of wine.

UPDATE: Thanks everyone! I already did a bottle of wine as a welcome gift so I opted for an apology note and box of chocolates truffles.

I currently have a young couple staying in my Airbnb (duplex unit) who don't have a rental car and get around by Uber. I saw them leave and get picked around noon. An hour or so later, I was going out and when I walked past their open kitchen window I heard water running inside. Guests leaving the faucet on is one of my biggest fears because my partner did that once in our place and ruined the cabinets. So in my imagination the place has been flooding for an hour or more and the water damage flashes before my mind's eye. I totally panic, grab my keys, and run in to turn the water off. First thing I realize it's not the kitchen sink but the shower that's running. Second thing is one of my guests coming out of the bedroom to meet me in the hallway. I stopped dead in my tracks, equal parts relieved and mortified. I don't know who spoke first, but I started blubbering ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I didn't know you were here, I thought you went out and left the water on, I'm so sorry, I just heard the water running..."" and my guest saying ""It's okay, don't worry, we just got back, it's fine"" and I said something like ""Thank you, I'm sorry, take care"" and quickly left and locked the door behind me.

I've only been hosting for about six months and this is easily the dumbest, most embarrassing thing I've done. I still can't believe I did that. I usually always knock and announce myself loudly if I have to go in for some reason even if I'm sure the guests are not there. I suppose it could have been worse, I'm lucky they weren't naked or something. They didn't seem upset at all, just mildly surprised. But what if they didn't believe me about the water and think I was snooping around. I'm kicking myself pretty hard right now. So I guess cautionary tale for hosts, don't panic, always message first, or at least knock before you burst in on your guests!

TL;DR I mistakenly went into emergency mode and entered my guest's apartment thinking they had gone out and left the faucet running, but in fact they were already back and getting ready to shower.

adae8b92-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guest listed the Airbnb she booked,"Hello all! Thank you in advance for your input. I co-host & am concerned about a guest who booked January 2nd - January 17th. The host looked at her Airbnb profile and noticed she has our Airbnb listed. Photos of the inside of our apartment, and the listing title boasts our cross streets (major tourist area in Denver, Colorado). 

Her listing has no description; it’s very basic. This is concerning to me. The host does not want to confront her about it because he does not want to lose the reservation. We are both perplexed as to what she is doing. I’m concerned and would like to be proactive about this. 

Update- I had a friend send her a message asking about the parking situation & other specific details, and based on her answers I’m now certain that she is “re- airbnb’ing” the apartment. She signed off by saying, “you will luv the unit”.

Update- host called Airbnb. FWD: After a few conversations first Airbnb rep said definitely cancel and try to get a refund. Since guest was violating the agreement. And it was definitely weird.

But then he referred me to someone else. She said guest is not doing anything wrong and Airbnb doesn't even have a terms of service.
So if I cancel the reservation I will have to refund her. She said we would have to refund her since the guest didn't really do anything wrong at our place.

Update- the guest removed the listing! Thank you so much to everyone who responded! The advice was very helpful! ",0.93,50,1546489902.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/ac1yls/guest_listed_the_airbnb_she_booked/,True,84
adae8d0e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guest stays for most of the night and then cancels and gets a refund. What now?,"I have hosted a few times and have had amazing guests. So amazing that my last guest left me a fridge full of craft beer. My dad, who has recently retired and has a huge house all to himself, decided that he wanted to give it a try. He has a section of his house with a private entrance that he used to rent out as an apartment. We (I'm his co-host) published the listing on the site last week. Our first day that we would be able to get bookings was May 26 (Saturday).

At around 7pm on Saturday night, we get a message from a couple who are requesting to book us for two nights starting that night. They said that they had to cancel the airbnb that they booked for the night due to bugs and inadequate air conditioning (should have been a red flag) and asked if they could book with us. Anxious to get going and get some feedback rolling in, we said yes.

They showed up an hour later and seemed really nice. My dad showed them the room and the bathroom. They were really positive and happy with the room so they decided to stay. My dad gives them keys, said to let them know if they need anything, and that's that.... At midnight that night, I get a notification that they had cancelled. I thought there must be some type of clerical error or technical glitch and just ignored it. I get a call from my dad in the morning saying the people left around 4AM. They left the keys in the room. They had used the bed in the room and the shower for most of the night.

We just shrugged it off thinking that something had come up or their plans had changed. On Monday, we get a notification from airbnb that the guest had been refunded their full amount. I contacted them this morning and they said that the guest said that there were bugs in the room and the shower was dirty (both not true). They didn't have too much to say, just said they would refer the situation to a case manager and they would call me back later.

It doesn't seem right that a guest can stay in the room for 8 hours and not have to pay anything. Is there anything we can do here? Also, I would assume that they are going to be leaving negative feedback (we have already left negative feedback for them). Since this will be my dad's first ever feedback on his host account, do you think it would be best to take down the listing, cancel his account, and create a new account to start over again?

Any tips or insight is appreciated :)

adae8e80-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,I spent the last 6 months cleaning/prepping for Airbnb units and have some tips for you all.,"As the title suggests I have been cleaning/prepping units for awhile now to make extra money. I am also a SuperHost with 5 years hosting experience, but feel like I learned more about Airbnb from cleaning/prepping other people's units than just focusing on my own. 

I know that many of these tips may seem obvious, but I was shocked at how things that I thought were common sense to most weren't, even with experienced hosts.  

- You should have on hand 4 types of cleaning products: all purpose, glass/mirror, bathroom cleaner and a toilet bowl cleaner. I am honestly shocked at how many hosts just do all purpose and glass at a bare minimum; especially in the bathroom you need the correct products to ensure that you don't get nasty buildup in your tub and toilet over time.
- With cleaning products I'm personally a fan of using more natural stuff as it doesn't give off an overwhelming toxic smell in the space and is more inviting.  
- Please supply paper towels and use them for cleaning. I use these in the bathroom (yeah, I know, not great for the environment) as it is a great way to scoop up any stray hairs and get them straight into the garbage especially when cleaning a tub/shower that doesn't have a detachable shower head. Using just a cloth or sponge just moves it around, and those hairs you initially picked up will just reappear somewhere else, and that's a surefire way to get dinged in cleanliness.
- Speaking of hairs, make sure you also have a lint roller. Even when clean sheets come straight out of the dryer they can have hairs clinging to them, and you don't want a guest to find these when climbing into bed. 
- Even if you just have hardwood/tile floors, please get a vacuum cleaner. It doesn't have to be fancy, but sweeping the floors just moves all the dust and hairs around the unit and never gets it quite right. Trust me: you need a vacuum.
- Having a mop is also necessary. The whole unit doesn't need to be mopped every single time, but the bathroom should be as well as any spot cleaning in the kitchen. 
- When it comes to bedding you need a minimum of 2 sets of sheets per bed as well as 2 sets of a duvet (if that's what you use). Having just one duvet means that with a 2 bedroom unit with lots of laundry there is hardly anytime to run an extra load for the duvet and get it out of the dryer in time, so it ends up sitting there all summer without a wash (yes, this is common and very gross). 
- 3 sets of towels at a minimum are required. You will always need extra towels as these get damaged easily. 
- When it comes to timing, I know that guests always want to check out late and check in early. However, I think that more hosts need to give themselves an extra hour for cleaning and adopt either a 10AM checkout, 3PM check in OR an 11AM checkout, 4 PM check in as 4 hours is just not enough for some of the 2 bed plus units. It's the reason why said duvet above does not get cleaned. There is no time and it's just not a priority when compared to sheets and towels. 
- Either hide your extra sheets/towels, or send a message to your guests when they check in to only use what is provided to them. I am all for people getting what they need for a stay, but oftentimes I've seen clean sets of sheets used for people sleeping on the couch (when they have snuck extras in) and this just adds to the already abysmal laundry situation. Same thing with using a new towel each day; guests feel entitled to it, but I'm sure if someone explained to them that the laundry is slower in an Airbnb and can cause a headache for the cleaners to prep in such a short period of time, they would be less inclined to ransack everything. 
- If you have a unit that requires multiple loads of laundry, ask the guests to start the first load before checking out. This helps significantly with timing and can ensure that other guests can check in early if need be. 
- For laundry soap, use something that has a scent. Guests won't think twice about whether it's clean or not. 
- When cleaning the toilet you can't just clean in the inside of the bowl; you need to clean the entire bowl from top to bottom. Dust and other gross things can build up and make a reasonably clean toilet appear not so clean. 
- When it comes to supplies, you are going to use a lot of toilet paper. Don't just run down to the store and buy one pack at a time. Stock up on that shit! The amount of times that I had to dash out and pick up TP for a unit because a host couldn't be bothered to stock the place properly happened far too often. This is not something that you want to run out of. Same goes for hand soap, shampoo/conditioner (if you provide that as well) and garbage bags. Seriously do not run out of garbage bags. 
- Have only one trash bin in the kitchen, and one in the bathroom. You don't need to have trash bins in every single room in the unit as this just creates more work for your cleaner to make sure to remember to take them all out. 

For those of you who clean your own units, you probably do most of these things already, or have figured them out. For those of you who hire cleaners I strongly suggest cleaning your own unit(s) at least once a month. It will give you a sense of the quirks in getting the place prepped and will be a good chance for you to check in on the quality of your items like sheets, towels, etc. As a fellow host I always let my hosts that hired me to clean know about damage, but don't trust that all cleaners will do this. Ultimately it is up to you as a host to keep up these standards, and the best way to do that is to clean your own units on occasion.

I was instantly annoyed when I first saw the headline, because I assumed it was yet another way for Airbnb to screw over hosts.  But after reading further, this is a good compromise.

Under terms of the revised policy, which the company said will go into effect in coming months:

- If a guest chooses to provide a profile photo, that profile photo won’t be displayed to the host as part of the booking process until after the booking is confirmed.
- Airbnb will give hosts the option to ask guests to provide a profile photo prior to booking, which will only be made visible after the host accepts the booking request.
- As a fairness safeguard, hosts must proactively turn on their request for a photo before receiving a reservation request, even though they won’t see the photo until the process is completed.
- If a host asks for a profile photo, Airbnb will prompt guests to upload one to their Airbnb profile before they can request to book that host’s particular listing and the photo will not be presented to the host until after the booking is confirmed.
- If a host cancels a reservation after viewing a guest’s photo, the guest will have an easier way to complain to Airbnb, and hosts violating the policy may be permanently banned from using the site.

Stranger has out pool facilities listed for parties,"Just as the title reads, we have an issue with a stranger listing our pool for rent at our apartment complex. They don't live here and certainly do not have permission from the buildings owners or management. 

Why our place you might ask? It's old converted grain mill that's pretty unique. It's a favorite for local film makers and photographers. Queen of The South has filmed here a few times. Toyota has shot commercials here. Our deck top pool is pretty rad. Hell I'd rent it for a party if I had to.

I am working with our management team to have this pulled down; they are short staffed and frankly don't have the time. They have called ABnB to try and have the listing removed only to be stonewalled by AbnB support.

I have called and reported the listing four times now. Twice it was removed only to have the listing appear the next day.

It was easy to keep track of where I was staying and what I was doing on one app. Most of them were really good with engaging and informative guides/hosts. One was not. All of the reviews were very positive. ""Jacob is a great guide and we had a wonderful time."" ""My family was welcomed warmly by Jacob during our tour."" I was really looking forward to it.

But I did not get Jacob as a guide. I was met by someone who asked if I was waiting for Jacob. I got in a car with them thinking they would take me to Jacob. Instead they drove 3 hours to the tour's destination, dropped the guests off with a local guide, and then picked us up again for the return trip. Along the way, we stopped at two landmarks and the driver simply said something like, ""Here is a famous place. We can get out for you to take some photos.""

I was disappointed and my review reflected it. I also made clear that I didn't meet Jacob and the tour was done by someone else.

The guest called back to ask why, which I politely just said the room was unavailable now and Airbnb would help to find an alternative for him, he could come and collect his luggage too. He called back again and ask if he could stay the night until they found appropriate accommodation, to which I declined and reiterated the point above again. He then called me a third time threatening to come back for a 'reimbursement' of the delayed refund from airbnb and demanded I reimburse his taxi of £200 right now. I told him he had to return the keys and collect his luggage but I would not reimburse him. He told me to fuck off and continued to threaten me. I told him to not speak to me so aggressively and I would call the police if he tried to force entry, he laughed and again told me to fuck off, this time with his wife in the background, and told me i'd be paying for his accommodation tonight and the taxi fee as I'd 'fucked with him'. He then hung up. I've passed the case on and reported him to airbnb safety who are trying to mediate the return of the keys but now I am beyond scared and mortified by his response and worried he will show up. I feel so frightened!



I welcomed a guest to my apartment yesterday, first time hosting, and have had to cancel the booking as I felt increasingly concerned about my guest. First of all, he looked nothing like his profile picture. He also kept changing his reasons for staying (1 month in total), it began with himself and his wife were relocating from abroad, yet he then came and told me he was living elsewhere in the same city the whole time. He also showed up without his wife, who I have no name or reference for, she is apparently coming over today. He showed up 3 hours late, called me about 10 times to get here, kept asking the same questions about location, repeating himself, continuously asking me when I'd be leaving the apartment which was very concerning, and couldn't follow simple instructions to come to the apartment block and buzz up to the apartment.

When I greeted him, he stank of alcohol and cigarettes, and was clearly quite drunk. He couldn't retain any information or conversation I was trying to have with him. Did I mention he looked completely different to his profile picture!? He barely took any notice of the welcome pack, house rules or ensuite bathroom I showed him, wasn't interested in a tour or shared spaces. He quickly went into his room and within less than an hour he came out to tell me he was leaving and would return tomorrow with his wife, leaving his suitcase and not even leaving with an overnight bag. When I asked him if he would stay the night he told me 'not to worry about it'. 

I went into the room and he'd made a mess of everything he could in there (which wasn't a lot to begin with). The welcome pack was thrown onto the floor, the towels thrown all around the room and the bed linen was dishevelled and thrown over parts of the bed and floor too. There was also an empty bottle of wine left on the floor. It honestly looks very suspect.

I had very high hopes and was excited to be hosting my first guests, I'd cleaned the apartment to perfection and stocked up on supplies for them, genuinely very hopeful for this new chapter. This experience has worried me and it resulted in me contacting airbnb to cancel the rest of the reservation. Showing them photos of the room and the intoxication levels, they agreed it was not acceptable and have wavered penalties against me too. 

I think I was naive to expect a couple to be more respectful to my apartment and room, a business owner at that too. He also claimed he'd come from a business meeting when he arrived, must have been a liquid lunch!! Any tips from hosts for any similar experiences and how to avoid these types of bookings in the future?

adaeab22-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,My host called me poor for choosing her property and shameful for taking pictures of a dirty bathroom,"Having lived in Europe for a while I've gotten used to differences in customer service and general lack of ""customer is always right"" mentality. I actually think it's a bit more fair when businesses are not threatened by bad reviews. However even my tolerance has limits.

Long story short: rented a villa in Cote D'azur, the house wasn't too clean (hair in the tub, smudges on everything) which I was willing to let go until asked by the host if the check-in experience was absolutely spectacular. Having answered that it could have been a bit cleaner I was told that I should probably find a better place and move out. Being in a different country with a group including children finding a place in July in a resort town may not be so easy. We've politely requested to stay only to be harassed by texts saying we need to accept the refund and get out. After we moved out, the host proceeded to call me poor in the public review for choosing her place and for being petty and shameful for taking a picture of the hairy tub. She then continue with a ramble about being cool with spiders and centipedes visiting her rental.

Full review below:

&#x200B;

""Mitigated experience with OP & guests. The communication sounded very clear prior to arrival, somehow changed after check-in. Guest was aware I was away for vacation myself but that he’d be assisted for check-in. First message I received was questions, questions and upstairs bathroom complain after he found one hair and stained water (3 pictures to make it meaningful/ blameful). Since I wasn’t there, I’m not sure what were guest’s real concerns (coffee missing from my lady prospective, unclean bathroom from Alex perspective) I immediately took his concern seriously and suggested I could have the lady to come back or even, at his convenience offer a full refund so that he re-accommodates. ( I found 4 houses available around me, not at alex’s price- list -maybe. but not extremely difficult). Guest didn’t want to raise this to Airbnb while I did as a carefully as a gentle person. After this miscommunication episode which only consisted in raising complaints for “one hair” for that I can really show how big was the case. all was fine from Alex’s prospective, the house was okay, “overall likable” from his own words. So I don’t get this kind of posture. Would anyone come somewhere with a shortlist of concerns then to conclude all is fine? I don’t really get why this kind of guests considering themselves as VIPs while they chose Airbnb platforms and unlikely not 5\* hotels in the Côte d’Azur. Something that wouldn’t come to my mind ... I’m visiting Italy, the house I rented is visited twice a day by creatures (spiders, centipes, flies...) I could have raised this concern to Airbnb. But what would that be for? Am I not visiting a house that is located in the countryside ? Or maybe I should have called one hotel to promise me free-bugs room.??? I really don’t get it... and this kind of experience I would definitely not recommend to any host nor guest. Alex understood that somehow he went “off” the line. But still tried to ask if he could check out later than schedule (which is not my way of behaving if I were disapointed by a place/host). Communication by end of his stay was very limited: check out instructions. All the rest was kept “mitigated” - When I got home I discovered a place that was messed in reaction) - Poor people and I could even state: very poor people. I wouldn’t recommend himself nor his friends unless you live in a sterilized place. And be get to receive one complain. Either big or small...ones will justify it, even if it’s toilet paper missing or coffee capsules missing. ""

adaeb126-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Need urgent assistance, currently stranded!","Sorry for the big block of test, recap of issue below:

I booked the reservation with my family 5 months ago (confirmed August 6) for a week stay over Christmas... we are a family of 8 including two grandparents (seniors) and two kids (under 10). We travelled from California, New York, and Philadelphia to spend time together for Christmas at Disney World. 

We arrived yesterday to find other guests at the home who booked the home through Homeaway over 1 month after we had confirmed our reservation. 

We spoke to the property owner and spent 4 hours on the phone with various Airbnb customer services reps yesterday to try and rectify the situation. They acknowledged that there was a “synchronization error” on Airbnb’s part that caused the double booking but offered no constructive solution (homes in Disney for 8 days are pricey this time of year and Airbnb was initially unwilling to cover the difference for their error).  We were tired, frustrated, and spoke with several case managers (David and Frank), until they finally rebooked us into a new property that cost $362 more than the previous property for 7 nights (Airbnb covered the cost). We stayed in a motel last night hoping to get on with our vacation.

We woke up this morning to find that Airbnb had yet again double booked us in a house and we still have no place to stay. We have been on the phone with customer service since 7:45am this morning (nearing 5 hours now) and still have not been able to resolve the situation. We are sitting in the motel parking lot after checking out and waiting for Airbnb to get back to us but we have been on hold for over an hour. The kids are missing their first trip to Disney World and our family is very upset and distressed at this situation that Airbnb caused.

Any thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated! Any know (or can PM) of any escalation contact line? Nothing has worked for us so far, and all customer service calls have gone on hold and then disconnected after ~1 hour.

adaeb2ac-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Rant. I think I’m becoming racist.,"So....we live and host on a tropical island in the Philippines. Recently another island got “shut down” by the government because of pollution issues (Google Boracay) and since then the tourism mix of our island has changed dramatically. 

Prior to the shut down we got a range of different cultures but 99% of the guests have been wonderful including Chinese guests. BUT now we are getting inundated by a different socioeconomic group of Chinese guests that are driving us crazy. We have honed our listing over the last 3 years to impress upon guests that we are in a remote location so they need to be independent in terms of transport. This isn’t Beijing nor New York. You need your own transportation. No Uber, no public transport. Restaurants and shops are miles away. 

My messages to guests, when they first enquire, screams the need for independent transport over and over again (bike and car hire is freely available) I even make them agree to this clause before accepting the booking. BUT. Almost every second Chinese guest agrees to these terms then turn up looking to be fed, where is the restaurant, porter, and taxi rank! Ughhhhhhh! 

I realise this is most probably a cultural and language barrier but FFS. Short of turning away every Chinese enquiry I just don’t know what to do. In every instance we get great reviews so they seem to enjoy themselves but it’s pushing me over the edge. I’m not expecting much in the way of solutions but thanks for letting me vent. 

Edit: Spelt Google wrong....I’m going to hell. 

Update: I really appreciate everyone’s input. In essence I think I need a break but to summarise what I think is going on and from input of a Chinese friend. 

1. Chinese guests are new to Airbnb and really haven’t got to grips with what it is (in our case a real b&b)
2. They are really good at rationalising and ignoring information that doesn’t fit with their expectations
3. They “assume” that everything is like China and actually works. Like transportation etc
4. Our house has a certain uniqueness that makes the house the destination and clouds their judgement a tad. They want it as a photo opportunity. 
5. Language and cultural barrier (even though everything in the app and site is translatable

Story time!","I travel for my NDT inspection company and had an interesting experience with my AirBnB host on my first ever use of AirBnB. I woke up this morning to a canceled reservation and a drunk host. The host got drunk and was blaring music downstairs all night, which I don’t mind. The setup of this house is 3 guest rooms and an attic loft that has an entrance on the same level as the guest bedrooms but wrapped around the corner in the upstairs common area. Well later around midnight he came up the stairs stumbling around and tried unlocking my door, assumably thinking it was the door to the attic loft. No biggie he couldn’t get it unlocked, woke me up but moved on before I went to the door and looked through the peephole. He then went door to the room that’s not being used at the moment, which isn’t a big deal 2/4 doors. However, there is a young blonde nurse staying in the third room. That’s where it got awkward. He fumbled with her lock before realizing he once again didn’t have the right door, and then stumbled back down the stairs. Through the peephole I saw her crack her door open very concerned and confused as to what was going on, and knew she saw him stumbling back down. I was going to go out and talk to her but she quickly shut herself back in. I went to use the restroom and talk to our host who was now passed out on the couch downstairs, when she passed me by completely packed and she bolted, understandably. With him asleep and her gone, I just went back to sleep. 4:30am this morning I received an email stating that AirBnB is canceling and refunding my stay, so I packed up and left as well, host still passed out on the couch. I presume when someone reports something like that it just kicks everyone out until it’s resolved? 

The worst part for me is the fact that it was the closest AirBnB that is sub $100/night (per diem isn’t much) and now I’m at work with no place to stay. 

Guess it’s back to Hotels for now. What an interesting stay.",0.9,45,1564658591.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/ckn2ow/first_time_airbnb_user_started_off_well_and_then/,True,39

The listing allowed events and parties, we followed all rules, were quiet, did not have any trouble at all with the host during the stay, we even cleaned the house almost to the condition we arrived to it in.

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, when we checked in, she gave us a tour, which ended in the games room. There was a 10cm rip on the pool table which I distinctly remember seeing as I own a pool table too, and I know that it is quite a big rip. I did not say anything to the host, as I assumed she must be aware of a rip that big, we were also standing right next to it. I did not want to seem rude to point out the damaged table. Additionally, the table had lots of other marks and imperfections, so i assumed she must not pay it much attention.

&#x200B;

We checked in at 2:07, and probably were shown the games room at about 2:20pm. We immediately started setting up after the check in and finished at 3:15. I have a photo of us playing pool at 3:15 that clearly shows the imperfection in the table. I also have a photo at 5:30 where the rip is even more clear in the photo. When we checked out, 48 hours later she sent a message requesting $1500 for a fix of the rip in the pool table. We sent a very long message with our evidence to prove we did not cause this damage. She sent back a lengthy message describing her disappointment as she put so much effort into our stay and she thought we would be more reasonable, and that therefore the rip must have occurred before 3:15, which is crazy as we were setting up.

&#x200B;

I have also checked with my guests who were there at check-in, and they confirmed the rip was there. My main problem is that I do not wanna pay for damage I haven't caused. I'm young, and I cannot afford to give out $1500  without justifying why I must pay this money. We responded to her money claim and she has told us she will take it up with AirBnB, which leaves me worried as I do not know how much say I will get.

adaeb932-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,My First Ever Booking with AirBnB was a disaster !!,"So back in December 2018 for a weekend away with my friends i decided to try AirBnB as I've heard good things from friends that used it and being a bunch of lads we wanted something special but that wasn't super expensive.

I found a lovely apartment in Europe that looked really nice, it had a nice roof terrace, lovely rooms and was situated right in the center of the city, next to all the touristy stuff.

&#x200B;

So it was booked and the initial payment was completed ready for our trip on the 21st June 2019. A week before the final payment was made and then 3 days before i received information on how to gain access to the property when i arrive. Brilliant ! Me and my friends had not been away together for over 12 years so we was really looking forward to it - really impressed with everything so far.

&#x200B;

We was due to fly from the UK at 8:00am on 21st June as so i went to bed early as i need to be up around 5:00am. Did the usual thing and couldn't sleep so around 12:30am decided to turn my phone on to see if i could read something to help me drift off. Then i got an email stating the owner at cancelled my booked at 11:57pm with no reason, i was absolutely distraught and couldn't believe this was happening after i booked the accommodation over 6 months prior. I quickly received a message from AirBnB telling me not to worry and that they will find me alternative accommodation, they even called me from the US to say ""dont worry, we will send you a link of alternative accommodations and just pick one, dont worry about the cost too much, as we will be able to sort it out"". So i pick a reasonable property and send them a link back, then after around 25 minutes asking for updates or anything i get a message they are looking into it. I wait another hour (i need to be heading to the airport in 2 hours at this point) i hear nothing, they just completely stop talking to me. I decided by this point that i needed at least some sleep and hoped that by the time i was up and going to the airport that would of come back to me. I have an hour sleep and wake up at 5am, no response from AirBnB.  I couldn't wait any longer and decided to find normal, reliable hotel accommodation myself. As it was last minute everything was really expensive. In the end I found a hotel outside of the city center but it meant my group of friends had to stay in separate rooms - by this point i was just relived that we had somewhere to stay and the holiday wasn't ruined. The hotel was nearly double the cost of the AirBnB i had originally booked and to get into the center was a €17 each way.

&#x200B;

I didn't hear back from AirBnB until 6 hours after i arrived at my destination which was an apology and a £100 coupon for my next AirBnB. I think this is ridiculous for my first experience and i dont want to ever use it again, so the £100 coupon for AirBnB is pointless to me and doesn't cover any where near enough of what extra i had to pay due to the cancellation and them not helping me.  Has anybody else experience something similar where they just dont provide any help and ignore you and where the owner cancelled at the last minute.

&#x200B;

The silver lining in all this is that once all the stress and worry of finding my own accommodation we had a great time.

&#x200B;

TLDR: First time user of AirBnB, booked accommodation 6 months in advance, owner cancels 8 hours before i was due to fly to destination. AirBnB offer to find me alternative accommodation, send me a list of properties, then ignore me. I have to find my own accommodation, which is a lot more than AirBnB, not in the city center.

My cousin booked a home in La Jolla, San Diego, for 2 nights for a bachelor party weekend stay. The reviews for the place looked great, but when we arrived it was not in hospitable condition. Among the worst things were:

-eviction notice on front door (red flag)
-5 inch lizard in the living room that we had to catch and take out of the house
-plastic on the floor (obviously the floors weren't cleaned)
-one toilet had broken off seat, the other wouldn't flush/operate at ALL 
-rotten orange left in the sink
-bedding in two rooms had hair and stains on top that appeared to be semen or other bodily fluids

The last one was the worst - we could just not stand the thought of being in dirty sheets and beds, being exposed to God knows what.

Of course, none of this was mentioned or indicated by the host prior to booking.

We took photos of all these issues, and  contacted the host about a few of them with no response. We then immediately contacted Airbnb customer support (per policy of 24 hours upon discovering issues), packed up, and left to a hotel as we were disappointed and too disgusted to stay there. 

Airbnb refund policy is supposed to cover unsanity rental premises as well as basic amenities like toilets or sinks not in working order, yet so far in our communication with customer support we have been told that the host is denying the issues and that we may not be able to get a refund. 

This is no small price as I mentioned we are potentially out $1400! That is a devastating amount of money for a few young guys. Not to mention the thought of these people taking advantage of others is even worse. 

If we don't get our refund through the first instance of customer support, what would be the best thing to do? This amount of money to me seems like something we should get a lawyer for or take to small claims court.

So yeah, it should be interesting to see how all this gets resolved.  I'm not sure I'll be allowed to disclose airbnb's findings but people wanted an update.

adaec7a6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Airbnb: when all is good, it's good. But when you hit a bump, all hell breaks lose","9 times I have rented appartments through Airbnb.  8 times, it was perfect.  But recently, a host, after having accepted my renting request for my upcoming trip to Europe \(and with my credit card being charged consequently\), sent me a message saying that he has to cancel that reservation.  I think it was a scam attempt, but anyway, it's not the point.

I went to Airbnb's website in order to see what to do then.  I got to read the policy regarding that situation, but it took me something like 30 minutes to find how to contact Airbnb's support to explain that situation.  After I did, it looked as if the situation was handled properly, the lady at Airbnb's support telling me the whole thing has been cancelled, with no fees, and that my credit card account would be debited \(refunded\) accordingly.  She told me that will take 15 business days.  I was told so 20 some business days ago.

Yesterday, I went on my credit card account online, and I still haven't been reimbursed by Airbnb.  So, again, I decided to contact them.

After browsing through the site for 30 minutes, I just couldn't find how to send a request to support \(apparently the site was slightly redesigned\).  I found a link ""Contact us"", but when I clicked on it, it took me to a page where I could contact the host for my next trip!  Anyway, after I have lost close to an hour, on either the web site or on the phone \(I miraculously found the phone number somewhere on my mobile app\), to get in touch with a human, I was told to wait a little longer to get the refund on my credit card...  We'll see how it goes.

I'm an IT guy.  I used to work on Web site design.  I know that Airbnb's web site is designed to discourage people from contacting them.  It's not a bug, it's a feature.  And by the way, I have finally discovered that you get in touch with support through a feature call ""Provide feedback"" \(not ""Contact us""\), which, I think, is extremely counterintuitive.

As I wrote in this post's title, when all goes well, Airbnb is great.  But since things don't always go well in life, it's making me to question if I'll ever use Airbnb again.",0.98,47,1526471983.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8juc02/airbnb_when_all_is_good_its_good_but_when_you_hit/,True,34

I've gotten half a dozen more messages about it, even after explaining dynamic pricing and the discount system. They wanted a 3 week stay.

So I flagged, and blocked them for trying pay cash out side AirBB. Interesting timing, because the second I did it, their final message cam through complaining that they had nowhere to stay (broke).

I'm a pretty quiet guy, that's into computers and loathes conflict. My hearts racing at this minor issue, as I think it's possible that I just dodged one of these nightmare guests. My brother once was on drugs, and completely took advantage of my compassion for him, costing thousands and destroying my car. So this is tugging on the same heartstrings.

I just wanted to vent, and be grateful that I avoided some trouble. The responses to my earlier post were very helpful.

They also gave me 3 stars on cleanliness due to dust on the skirting boards, and today is the day they check for superhost. Dusting is now on my check list.

adaed26e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"7 things I that decide which Airbnb I'll pick, and hosts never seem to mention them","Context: I've been staying in Airbnbs for the past year and a half. I tend to stay in one Airbnb for 3-4 weeks on average. In that time: 

* 3 months South America
* 2 months USA
* 3 months Europe
* 4 months Australia
* 8 months Asia

So it's a fair geographic spread, although this forum leans very USA, which tends to be a lot less tenant friendly, than, say, South East Asia. Here are some things I look for and value in an Airbnb, and they're often not addressed in descriptions or photos. These tend to be the decisive factors in choosing where I'll stay.

I have a lot of friends who are in similar situations as me, and these often come up in conversation (but some are just me):

1. Blackout curtains. Doesn't necessarily need to be curtains specifically, but I love an extremely dark bedroom. Helps me sleep tremendously. Right now I'm in an Airbnb in Korea. It has the bedroom, followed by a thin laundry room with a sliding glass door, and then the outside windows, the only sunlight source. In the pictures there are curtains on the sliding door, so I was looking forward to a nice dark room to sleep in. I arrive, there are two sets of curtains, one is a mesh-like cut-out design, the other is a white tinted thin curtain, so essentially no blocking of sunlight. So I get bad sleep once the sun comes up.
2. Not on the ground floor, no elevator situation mentioned. OK, so on this one hosts \*sometimes\* mention them, but I'm surprised how rarely this is. Obviously, a lot of hosts won't mention it if they think it's going to make it harder to rent out. But I don't like lugging bags to the 3rd or 4th floor (my record was the 6th floor in Hong Kong, but I didn't mind that because it was mentioned and it kept the price down). And often they have a large, wonderful lift that they never talked about. I wonder how many great places I would have booked if they had bothered to put it in the listing.
3. Two pillows. This one doesn't come up that often, but sometimes I turn up and they just have one pillow on the bed. This one might just be personal to me, I sleep with my head between two pillows. My take, in general is, the more pillows the better. If I see a place with just one pillow on the bed in pictures, I'm not booking it. If they're optimizing that much on costs, I don't want to know where else they're cutting corners, and I tend to book mid to upper price in the market because I value quality.
4. Shelf space for clothes. The primary reason I want this is because I spend so much time in Airbnbs, but I feel way more comfortable and happy if I can set myself up so that when I look around it feels like I live there. An open suitcase doesn't give me that feeling. I don't have much stuff, but even if I'm staying 2 days, I always fully unpack. I also bought a suitcase with more space than I need so I could literally pack in 5 mins if I had to.  
There's a second, more subtle reason when I like shelf space. If I end up bringing a date back to my place, then if I have my folded open on the floor with my clothes in it's not good for two reasons. The first is that it looks messy and like I'm a college kid (I'm in mid 30s). Not very cool. Second, it tends to remind her that I may leaving soon. I don't hide that fact, but I also don't want to constantly remind them about that.
5. International powerboards. This has only recently come up. I carry a bunch of international adapters but arriving in my current Airbnb in Korea they have a powerpoint I don't have an adapter for. Also, they have safety powerboards where the plug is recessed, as a safety measure, so most adapters wouldn't work anyhow. My previous Airbnb in Korea had an international powerboard.  
This makes sense to have for an Airbnb when you think about it. Yes, guests should plan accordingly, but this is also one of those details where if I see it mentioned in the listing I'll think ""if they have this detail right, then I'm sure they've put a lot of thought into everything, and have a lot of pride in their space"". I also spent 2-3 hours finding an adapter so I could get down to work. Part of the cost of the lifestyle sometimes (and it saves me from organizing plumbers, etc) but still something I'd prefer to see improved.
6. \[Bonus\] Netflix TV. This isn't a dealbreaker, but a dealmaker. I don't want regular TV. Few people under 35 do these days (large part of the market). It's super nice to be able to just throw on Netflix easily at the Airbnb. So many Airbnbs I stay at have these large, gorgeous flatscreens, etc, and I've never once used them except when you can log in to Netflix quickly and easily. To be fair, many folks with this do put it in their listing, I'm just surprised how few places have this.
7. \[Bonus\] Not sending the address as a separate, standalone message in the messaging app on Airbnb. Wait, why is this an issue? Well, when using Airbnb app over mobile they don't let you copy part of a message. You either copy the whole message or not at all. So then I have to copy it to my notes app, delete the text around it, then copy it to my Google Maps. This is partly Airbnb's fault. At my current Airbnb, I decided to just grab the address in the listing. Then I lugged my bags 20 mins from the train station to the pin. That's when I realized the address in the listing, and the address they had sent me over app where different. Look, definitely ways I could have prevented this.

The interesting thing about this list, to me, is that while I could email the host before booking to check if they have these items, this doesn't scale very well. They're also smaller details, so I would probably come across as a picky, high maintenance guest if I asked. Also, a lot of places don't have these items, so it's just a reality.

Do folks have other little items that are harder to figure out from photos or descriptions? Also, what do hosts think of providing these items? Totally you're prerogative if you don't, I'm just curious if you've considered them before or if any seem harder to do than I would think?",0.76,48,1563535445.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/cf6c9g/7_things_i_that_decide_which_airbnb_ill_pick_and/,True,161
adaed4c6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Host left me my first bad review and it has really upset me,"So, I have been using Air Bnb since about 2016 with no issues this far. I have only stayed in a couple of properties, but every host I've been with has left me a glowing review. Until now. Normally, I tend to rent an entire apartment, but on this occasion, due to it being a bit of a last minute trip, I opted for a private room that had its own private bathroom. The room was fine and I left the host a five-star review. I didn't deem it necessary to dock stars since the room met my needs for the most part. However, the host left me quite a scathing review.

&#x200B;

Firstly, she complained that I had too much trash in the room. I will admit that I did not take the trash out and I should have asked for instructions, however she also did not explain the process of taking out the trash when I checked in or in her message to me the night before I checked out. I left my rubbish in three small bags neatly in the room. I take responsibility for not asking how to take out the trash, and I explained this in my private feedback.  However, I didn't think it was fair for her to disparage me for not taking out the trash when she didn't explain to me how to do it. I spoke to a friend of mine who lives in the same city and he said that they have a very specific way of removing rubbish, and I could not have known unless it was explained to me. She accused me of lacking common sense when it came to disposing of the rubbish in a private message after, yet she didn't explain the procedure. She also said I left three trash bags worth of rubbish which just isn't true at all. 

&#x200B;

Secondly, she said I left the bathroom in a mess. I did a quick sweep of the shower and toilet before I left, but since she left no cleaning materials, i was quite limited in what I could do. If there had been cleaning materials, I would have happily cleaned the bathroom more thoroughly. When I mentioned this to her, she said that they don't provide cleaning materials because a cleaner comes in after each guest (I paid a cleaning fee), and that I could have cleaned the toilet with some ""toilet paper and water"". 

&#x200B;

I have contacted Air Bnb about this, as I don't think the review was fair. I understand that they likely won't remove it, but will this impact on my ability to get accepted in future? I have responded to her public review of me, so I hope that future hosts will take that into account.

* the unit I got (but left): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkzK44UfmRQ

...but since the host offered me several (also completely different) ""upgrades"", AirBnb won't give me a refund.

The scam, which I've encountered before, seems to be evolving:

* The host repeatedly tried to move the convo off AirBnb and onto WhatsApp, which I resisted.
* The host *asked me* (in an actual AirBnb message, mind you) to stay an additional night in order to ""see"" if the original unit was available, then later turned around and used the fact that I had stayed an additional night instead of having left.  Of course AirBnb can read these messages, but it seems that they have decided not to care.
* The host repeatedly offered several ""upgrades"", but none of them made good sense for me like the listed unit did.  However, AirBnb decided that since I had decided not to take any of these ""upgrades"" that I'm on the hook.

The text of their policy still says:
> ""our Guest Refund Policy will make sure you either get the listing you booked or receive a refund.""

...but it seems that AirBnb has quietly departed from this policy.  You can see my back-and-forth with them here: http://dpaste.com/3AF6YKM

I don't see how I can continue to use AirBnb if this is the new normal.  We're just supposed to hope that whatever unit the host places us in is good enough?  This is a really crazy turn of events.  Maybe AirBnb is finally running out of VC money and needing to cash in on some of these scams, and so turning more toward protecting the big hosts who occasionally do this.

edit: AirBnb messaged me and told me that they're giving me a full refund.  Their reasoning was:

>  I have granted your request for a full refund to be issued for reservation because via the message thread the host admitted that you were placed in the wrong listing.

I'm not sure how I'll proceed.  This has been an incredible amount of effort.  Is AirBnb still worth it?  I don't understand how to proceed differently in the future.",0.88,43,1540188331.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/9qb0vo/airbnb_has_quietly_stopped_protecting_guests/,True,39

After reaching out to the guest to replace the items and then escalating it to AirBnB, I was told that an AirBnB guest is entitled to all consumable items found in the listing and neither the host guarantee nor a security deposit will cover it. This includes food, drinks, paper towels, soap, etc. (i.e. anything consumable) in any location the guest has access to.

I want to file a damage report to Airbnb because I will need to repair the lawn when they leave. What would you do about this? I don't know how to calculate the cost.
I really can't understand how you can think that it's perfectly normal to build fires in people's private lawns, any lawn for that matter.

So we initiate messaging with AirBNB, we have them the only other listings available in the area for our time frame and they could not manage to get us into any of them.

We finish dinner and call them on the phone because it has been an hour and a half. They refuse to answer questions about how to proceed, at this point they ask us to us the messaging system which we do for another hour. Still no place to sleep...

Application stops working and we call for the sixth time as they would say we would be contacted and they never did. Still refusals to give us information on what cost of hotel will be covered for the inconvenience. 

I worked a full day, then we picked up another couple to drive up for the weekend of fun together. It’s been four hours now and I’m finally lying in a bed but with no assurances that AirBNB will cover this stay and it’s only for tonight not all three that we were planning on.

Please advise, I co-host 2 Properites for a friend. 
Recently we have been getting terrible guests. However before we accept a booking we always read the reviews and these guests have had wonderful reviews. Today we had to kick a guest out as he set up a music session in our apartment. Where the rules clearly state that no partying or loud music. 

On top of that he booked for one guest , but there was 6 people in the apartment. 

Please help 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

ETA : These guests were filthy, when we moved the fridge to clean there were maggots under it. As the bin is next to the fridge. And under the couch. I am so annoyed by all of this.

ETA 2: Thank you everyone for your words of wisdom. Our helper cleaned our apartment yesterday it looks totally new. Just need to go air the place out before the guest checks in later today. 

On a different note if a guest does not have a review is it rude to ask them the nature of their stay (business or pleasure) ?

I would just like to share my recent experience with Airbnb, I booked and paid for a property in New Orleans in August 2018 in preparation for Mardi Gras February 2020, 3 weeks ago and after just shy of 12 months of it being booked the host canceled and the hosts booking page was suspended. 

I did received a full refund which was little help as the prices in New Orleans have gone up considerably as Mardi Gras is approx only 5 months away now. 

The thing that has really annoyed me is that last night the host messaged me through Airbnb to inform me the house is available again albeit just over double what Id initially paid, my first booking totalled £1019 now the host's price for the exact same dates are £2189.

My family and I are currently staying in a private villa in Bali, Indonesia. We were told - not asked - today that one person was going to be coming through to look at the villa for a future rental, this ended up being 5 people who let themselves in without even knocking and then walking through the villa. If this wasn't bad enough  two hours later I was awoken by my daughters who informed me that another 6 people had let themselves in and were looking around. 

I've honestly never dealt with anything so bizarre at an airbnb before so I am a little confused what to do now?  We have two more nights booked here but honestly we feel a little unsafe knowing that at any time someone could just walk into the villa that we paid for, with all our belongings and valuables around the place.

Advice if anyone has been in a similar situation would be appreciated

adaef014-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,I just fucked up BIG with a guest!,"I was waiting for a guest that booked like a month ago to arrive to the listing today at 430AM, we agreed on a self checkin (I'm really hard to wake up with alarms and I could had easily just snooze it and keep sleeping...), it took till 1AM for that, since his internet was coming and going, but we did it. After that I was having a really hard time getting asleep, and just managed to do it at around 3AM.

The thing is that at around 5 something AM a call wakes me up.

I barely get what they are talking about and just hang up to continue sleeping (I do stupid stuff when I'm asleep). After a minute they call again,after some time speaking I got that they were calling from the migration's office, and were asking if I rented my place to someone from the US.

I was like really confused here (WTF), I wasn't waiting to anyone from the US, the guy was arriving from a neighbor country and I didn't recalled him being from the states, I asked them to tell me what was the name of the person, which they refused to do, just continuing escalating with questions about me waiting for several US citizens now.

I reiterated to them to tell me please the name of the person that arrived (I didn't wanted to just say yes to unknown people, that could end up being someone else and bring me legal troubles), they again asked the same question and here I rose my voice telling them that I just woke up, that I barely understood them and asked for the name again, at that point they just hang up the phone.

I went running to the pc, turned it on, and got into the site to check where this guy I was waiting for was from, cause I remembered seeing weird characters in there (which right now I just googled were Thai writing) and the country line certainly wasn't the US....But resulted that after checking that carefully, it was  is a city of the US followed by the state abbreviation!

&#x200B;

Why in the world would Airbnb show to a user that isnt from the US the state of another user, instead of the country in the ""from"" field, like with any other user from another country??????!!!!!!! @#$@#$@%@

&#x200B;

I grab the phone that instant and call back the number I was called from, but they just hung up, tried several times but nothing (I guessed they got mad I rose my voice :(). I then called the migration offices in the airport to tell them that I was indeed waiting for a US citizen but they just told me they aren't authorized to tell me anything.

&#x200B;

Kept then calling the first number (like 10 times), until they took the phone. I apologized for rising my voice when they called first, explained why it happened, they accepted it (and even apologized for calling me so early) but said that the guy already left the queue with a rejection and that they could do nothing to fix the situation!!

I hanged up devastated... Then called back again to ask if it was possible for me to go to the airport and fix this somehow, but they said that they couldnt do anything and if I called them again or go to the airport, they would call the police on me...

&#x200B;

Called back the main offices, gave the whole name of the guest, the country where he came from, and asked for any info on his situation, to which they told me that his entry was rejected and he was going back to the country of origin!

&#x200B;

I am totally devastated right now.  I totally ruined someones plans and that now he gonna even hate the whole country because of me and will never want to return again to see it. F\*$k! It's the first time I know they call someone to verify someone's address (been hosting in different platforms for 10+ years), specially at that time of the night. :/

No problem, I allow 2 people max. My smartlock was being unlocked and relocked almost every 10 minutes all weekend. This happened for 5 hour stretches usually, then would stop for a bit and start again. I suspect drug dealing, but I have no proof of that. 

I took a trip over to my building when I noticed it starting to happen again. Sure enough, he was welcoming 3 people into the unit and I confronted them in the hallway. I kicked them out and gave the guest 1 hour to gather his things and leave (he had 1 more day booked). 

Rules broken - several extra guests in and out all weekend. They smoked in the unit. I could smell it and there were ashes both in the bedroom and all over the balcony (it is not allowed building wide and it states it very clearly on an info page the keys are on when they arrive, as well as the house rules).

adaef46a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guests decided my outdoor camera offended them and damaged it,"Hello,

I've been an airbnb host for about 2 years and I rent out my 3 BR house. I recently got a Blink outdoor motion based camera and installed it right in plain sight outside my front door, away from arm's reach because some guests have a habit of bringing additional guests/pets etc. without disclosing.

The camera wasn't an issue until my most recent guest. The guy had pretty decent reviews but he mentioned he was making the booking for his dad/grandparents and cousins. Keep in mind that I had mentioned having an outdoor security camera multiple times in my listing.

I'm not exactly sure what ticked off this particular person in their group, but I got a video notification of an old man yanking the camera off the mount and throwing it on the ground. The video feed is all messed up now and has a pink hue. 

I charge a security deposit with every listing, is this grounds enough to charge the guy for damages? I'm honestly at a loss for words as to why the camera offended the guy. It was in plain sight, only near the entrance and I even had a big ""protected by blink video security"" sticker right next to it.

I had an incident before where a guest damaged my bed, and airbnb wanted an estimate from a professional for repairs, which honestly was more trouble than it was worth so I let it go. I don't feel like letting this go, mostly because the guest can't even be assed to respond to my mesage asking what the hell?

Any advice would be appreciated!

**edit:** The guest finally responded (funny how that happened right after I submitted a claim) and maintains that the Camera was like that on the ground when their party first arrived. I have video proof showing otherwise. Now they're maintaining that the camera must have ""fallen off the mount by itself"" during their stay and the guy in the video was just inspecting a fallen camera before leaving. This **could** be a possibility, however the mount is pretty secure.

I have no way to prove that he actually yanked it off the mount since the act is not something my camera can record (The camera only records based on motion events and there is a slight delay). However, what I do have is a video of the guy inspecting the camera and throwing it on the ground. I'm sure this was right after he plucked the camera off the mount, since the camera starts recording about 3-5 seconds after motion.

If it did fall off during their stay, the fall would trigger a motion and recording event, but I do not have any video showing this.

If what they're saying is true, why not inform me during their stay or even after checkout?

What do I do here? Give them the benefit of the doubt?

**double edit**: Case solved! The old guy who pried the camera off the mount did not think that the camera would continue recording after he pulled it off. He thought it was a wired camera, and since I had video evidence of the guy eye fucking my camera and dropping it **after** he plucked it off, I win. They agreed to pay after I sent them a link of this video, but will not admit any guilt or fault of course!

Anyway, the description says they're a couple happy to share their home. They've lowered the price to the minimum and will refund the money once you bring the poetry. Weird, but they have a dozen positive reviews. I sent a request to book, writing in the message that I have a couple poems to share.

I received an immediate rejection with the message ""you've misunderstood the difference between poems and poetry."" Uhhh what? I mean, the description even says it can be in any language, written by anyone, etc. I sent them a message asking what 'poetry' means but received no reply.

I had a busy few days so I only met him for the first time yesterday when I stopped home to change and primp briefly before going out with friends.  All he kept talking about was how sad he is that his wife died a month ago. (He made me late to meeting my friends because it was really difficult to extricate myself from that conversation.)

I came home around midnight and fell asleep watching Netflix quietly in my room with the door locked.

I woke up this morning to a 1AM message saying basically “don’t take this the wrong way, but if you’re bored and want to cuddle just tap on the door… you’re a beautiful woman, blah blah”.  He had already left, luckily, so I didn’t have to face him.  I’ve hosted dozens of guests and this is the first incident like this.

I’m mixed about giving him a negative review, because he was a nice guy and his attraction could just be that we are of similar age (40s) and I live alone. But what if... 

He sent me a second, lengthier and more explicit text dlast night. I texted back simply ‘this is an appropriate, I’m in a relationship, don’t contact me anymore.’

UPDATE 1:  I Forgot to mention that the only reason reporting him made me nervous at all was because he moved to my area. So the fact that he’s now a local who knows where I live is the reason it was even a question.

UPDATE 2: Ok, so I left his review.  Thumbs down, I said in the review what he did and that he‘s better suited for male hosts, and a private message to him explaining why it’s totally wrong.  Blocked and reported to Airbnb, but their reporting system is quite sparse. No way to leave details.

UPDATE 3: I’m livid.  He left me a scathing negative review full of lies about my place and me personally.  I’m a superhost with a 4.9 rating currently.  Users cannot see others’ reviews before they post theirs so this must’ve been only from me rebuffing him (briefly but firmly) by text!  I am in the process of reporting to Airbnb. I talked with a woman on the phone and emailed her screenshots of the text message. She’s compiling a report that will be considered in removing his false review.  I’ll update with outcome after she calls me back in about 30 minutes.

adaf043c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Professional Airbnb Scammer/Squatter Occupying my small condo,"Hello All,

I have a one-bedroom vacation rental condo in Palm Springs that has been listed on AirBnB for about a year now. I have my first stressful problem: a vacation renter with a 44 day reservation who will NOT leave now that the reservation has expired. (Payment was received for first 30 days, but not for the remaining 14 days). This is all new, to me, and I believe I have a professional scammer on my hands.

Unfortunately Airbnb has not provided support, and is only helping me via email responses every 48 hours or so. The information from Airbnb has been confusing, convoluded and contradictory at best. The summary is that somehow Airbnb collected payment for the first 30 days rental, and was unable to collect payment for the remaining 14 days. The renter has been there 14 days without paying. Today is the date that this reservation expires. (Original reservation May 25-July 8th.)

The tenant is refusing to leave, and sent me a text message (see long text message pasted below) on July 8th that bordered on blackmail. 

Airbnb has deleted ALL conversations I had with this squatter on the airbnb site. Airbnb refuses to give me an airbnb.com contact person phone number to consult with this issue. I have hired an attorney and we are proceeding with unlawful detainer/eviction. We are also proceeding with attempting to preserve evidence, retrive deleted/removed info from airbnb.com site.

For hosts out there--I hope you can learn from my situation, and I will be blogging about my horror story at www.myairbnbsquatter.com once I get the okay about what I can share publicly. If you have any problems with your tenants, please take screen shots, or save your airbnb inbox conversations in a PDF, etc so that you can have them for reference before airbnb tries to cover up. Airbnb still refuses to give me a direct contact contact phone number...its a mess. 

Please let me know if you have idea for getting my story out...I have been gathering ideas, and I'm open for suggestions. 

Thanks for reading.

Yes, they are polyester fill.  No, they aren't designer.  But they hold up well, our guests have loved them, and when one stains or rips its so cheap you just toss it.  We always stock up (and we just did again) because there simply isn't a better value out there for price vs. warmth vs. utility.

adaf0bf8-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Never using this platform ever,"My friends and I booked an apt for the labor day weekend, and Friday morning, I got a call from an Airbnb case manager Angelo saying that the host needed to cancel my trip because of her “medical emergency”. I told Angelo that since the entire check in process can be done without her presence, and he was ok with it and told me to proceed with the trip. 

We got there, there’s already a group of four girls staying in the apt. Turned out that the host had double booked on both Airbnb and Booking.com, and instead of trying to solve it, she lied about having a medical emergency. I called the Airbnb customers services, was directed to case manager Vernetta. 

Keep in mind, it was midnight in nyc, and I was running a fever of 102 the entire day. All we wanted was a place to rest. The other group called Booking.com customers service, and were offered a FULLY PAID rebooking at any hotel in nyc that’s available. 

And shockingly, my group was offered only an extra 10% of our original payment only if we were to rebook with another Airbnb host. We suggested that we’d like a hotel room of similar price, paid by Airbnb, and was rejected. 

I can not express how disappointed I am right now. I don’t know how many times I have used this wonderful platform. Every time I travel, first thing comes to mind is:”let’s get an Airbnb.” Never will I ever use this platform again, and to whoever can see this thread: the quality of customer service is so important when it comes to a situation like this. You can tell that Booking.com values that customers way more than Airbnb did. 

Thanks for listening to my ranting. I’m supposed to go to a festival in nyc, but caught the bad cold, and now this happened. Hopefully my luck will turn around:) 

Edit: sorry I didn’t explain this clearly: the first case manager, Angelo, told me to proceed with the listing. Because we both thought that since the check-in process can be done without her presence.

When we arrived we got there and got the keys. The air b n b host let us but he was absolutely wasted. Told us we were going in the wrong way, grabbed the keys and asked us what country we were from, what state we were from and city we were from as if we were foreigners who couldn’t read. Then proceeded to completely trash talk one our towns and was sarcastic/mean while he showed us to our place. Said he would put I minimal effort into our stay. Dude is huge, 100lbs at least bigger than boyfriend and me. We locked the door and are now really nervous/scared to leave since he was right outside our room shit talking us to his drunk friend. The area we were in is almost booked out for the festival. In addition there are no towels for the bathroom. We are now going to take our stuff and bounce but still have two nights left.

adaf11b6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guests are refusing to leave early after repeatedly breaking several house rules,"UPDATE: We had Airbnb cancel the reservation on their end (what they actually did was manually change the dates so that the reservation ended today at 11am). We found out that the guest was not responding to any messages or phone calls from Airbnb, which is what finally got them to take us seriously. It was like pulling teeth to get them to actually do this. We contacted our guest to make sure he knew what we were doing and when we were doing it, ie calling the police.

Once we confirmed that our contract with the guest was effectively broken, I called the non-emergency line and they sent an officer to our house. The cop basically said we were screwed. He had a good working knowledge of WA state landlord/tenant laws and told us that since the guy paid us ""rent"" and they'd been there for a few weeks, he could not forcibly remove them. He told us that since we're not a business, we fell under private residence landlord laws and would have to go to the county to begin the process of eviction.

THEN WE GOT LUCKY

The guest saw the police vehicle outside while the officer was speaking to us in our garage. I guess they got scared because shortly after, one of their friends pulled up in an SUV, packed up all their stuff and they left. We made sure they left the key. I am relieved but also can't believe our luck. We would have literally had to go through a months long court process to get these people out because there's not really any protection for us under the law.

Thank you to everyone who commented with advice, I really appreciate all of your support.

***

Let me start out by saying my cohost (who is the primary and also my fiance) has been on the phone with Airbnb MULTIPLE times about these guests concerning several broken rules and other offensive behavior.

Tonight, things have taken a turn for the worse.

The way our Airbnb is set up is, we own our house, we live here. We have two listings, one for each of our guest bedrooms.

The guests in question are from Egypt and are apparently immigrating here to the US (we live in Washington state) and made a reservation in a room inside our house for 31 days. It is a man, his wife and his 2-year old daughter.

The first big red flag for us came around Day 6. The man asked us if we owned the house. When we said yes, he asked if he could use our address to have his stuff sent here. He said he was waiting for a social security card, etc. to come in the mail. My fiance was clear and firm: No. My fiance offered to help the guy find out how to get a PO box or other type of mailing service. The guest replied that he needed a social security # to open one. I don't believe that's true, but whatever. We held firm: Sorry, you can't use our address.

Around Day 16 we get a message from the guest in the app saying he went ahead and used our address to get a credit card sent to him. ""Sorry"" he said. ""Hope it's not an inconvenience!""

My fiance about lost his mind. He called Airbnb and had them call the guest to tell him he couldn't do that and that we would be returning any of his mail to sender. Since then, they have broken multiple house rules and we've finally had enough. 

It's now the early morning hours of Day 25. They still have six nights left on their stay, but we want them out now. We have asked them to leave because they have broken so many rules. Every time we've asked them not to do something, they do it anyway. It's clear they have no respect for us. We had Airbnb call them twice to tell them they need to leave by 11am tomorrow (today). 

But tonight, the guest made it clear he is flat out refusing to leave. He told us he would call 911 on us, whatever that means. I am afraid that they are trying to establish residency here somehow with the mail, etc. and plan to stay past the 31 days.

If anyone has any advice on what more we can do to get them out, it would be greatly appreciated. If they have been unable to get mail here and haven't stayed 30 days yet, does that mean they don't get tenant rights? Do they fall under the category of squatters at that point? Can the police forcibly remove them? This is insane. It's a nightmare and I wish we never did Airbnb.

tl:dr Guests have repeatedly broken house rules, tried to have mail sent here after we said no and are now refusing to leave despite being asked by us and Airbnb because they still have six nights. Is there any way to get them out?

EDIT: Since a lot of people have asked, here are the rules they've broken in the first three weeks. Keep in mind, we have been beyond patient and forgiving - many of these rules have been broken multiple times at this point.

* Leaving the front door unlocked when leaving or returning
* Cooking on our gas stove in the late night hours
* Not disarming the security when they leave or return, allowing an ear-splitting alarm to go off and our security company to contact us.
* Inviting other people (their friends?) into the house without our approval
* Wearing shoes in the house

The above are all things clearly stated in our listing. Here are the other concerning issues we've had:

* Having a hot plate in their bedroom, which short-circuited the power to that area of the house.
* Taking a shower without the shower curtain, resulting in a lot of water splashing over and getting down the vents (we had taken the curtain to wash it, it was 11pm and we thought they were asleep)
* Body odor so bad we are worried it's affecting the stay of our other guests.
* Asking us for darker colored sheets because the 2-year old will make light-colored ones dirty (is she wetting the bed?)

adaf1c9c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,PSA: Turn off instant booking and don't ever accept rental requests from baby boomers.,"TL,DR: Boomers give terrible ratings even with good reviews. AVOID.

Hi guys,

I know this title sounds terribly ageist, and I apologize for that. I should say I usually love old people especially my neighbors, some of the most interesting and nice people I know. But I really feel the need to share my 1 year experience as a Airbnb host for all you new hosts out there.

Bit of a background: 

I live in a mid sized university town in Southern Ontario, bought a house in late 2016 with a brand new finished half-basement apartment. I chose this house partially because of the 2 bedroom apartment style basement which has a separate entry that makes it perfect for Airbnb. 

I had used Airbnb before as a guest and really enjoyed my experience, so I figured I'll give hosting a try. I'm a single guy that lives in a big house alone anyway, if anything it'd be less lonely. 

So far, in the past year, I have hosted about 20 different guests, they are mostly mid-term stays, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months. This is not a tourist town by any stretch so my guests mostly consist of:

**PHD researchers who are on a short term contract.**

& 

**People who are in between rental contracts and just need a place to stay for a bit before their new lease.**

Now, because not a lot of people use Airbnb in this town, I'm assuming, the average rating of Airbnb hosts are super high, like, 4.3 high.

I know this because I got suspended by Airbnb once for 2 weeks, because my rating got down to 4.2. 

And this is how:

**Every single boomers I've hosted, and I mean every single one of them**, gave me a 3 star review. While everyone below the age of 55 gave me 5. 

This include the first boomer I hosted, whom upon his request, I had bought a dining table set, a coffee machine, a set of coffee mugs, because he asked and I thought it was a good idea. It's a new house anyway and I should have these basic amenities, I thought.

Now, after 4 boomers, and numerous other upgrades I had done to the apartment, I started to pick up a pastern and decided I would stop accepting requests from boomers.  But I **forgot to turn off instant booking**. And a 
 college professor from the States had booked a room and came in town for a uni conference, again left me a 3 star review. 

The funny thing is, they always leave nice reviews, words. Things like ""good value"", ""nice location"", ""met my expectation"", and then baaaang, a 3 star rating. 

I think they really don't understand the star system and think they should rate the place by hotel standards. But man, you are paying $30 bucks a night. 

I give gifts for all my guests at the start of their stay and a hand written note with instructions on wifi and other stuff, along with a friendly reminder they should give a 5 star review if they liked their stay. 

But no way. The only five 3 star reviews I have all come from them and I officially am done with these people.

On the other hand: [Reviews from my other guests](https://imgur.com/a/6FHfp)

adaf1fe4-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Been left stranded in Berlin,"Hey everyone,

Me and my girlfriend decided to take a vacation to Europe and one of our destinations is Berlin (from September 2nd to 9th). We had already booked our travels and accommodations well in advance along with our Airbnb stay here. Our booking was confirmed by the host and our money went through too, but when we arrived at the door she said that she hadn't confirmed anything and hadn't received any money either and didn't have a profile up anymore as she wasn't hosting anymore.

We got in contact with AirBnb and after almost four hours of talking with the support service (being on hold for 1.5 hours) we were able to agree that they would reimburse us for the night for under 100 Euros. This was only because it was past 1:30 am and there were no hostels or affordable hotels around. We did get a full refund along with that and they promised to find us an accommodation within our budget for the remaining days. Today morning however, we just got a link to the Airbnb website for our dates and location so we could scout out a new place to stay.

Currently Airbnb and hotel prices for our dates are more than 7 times our budget, and all hostels are booked out as Berlin is a popular destination. Airbnb says that they cannot help us anymore than total of 150 pounds + the reimbursed money for the night at the hotel. It seems like they're expecting us to cut our trip short, spend money we don't have or sleep on the streets because it's been 7 hours since we last had contact with our 'case manager' and we're approaching 7 pm with no idea where to go tonight when we were promised constant help and accommodation. 

Does anyone have any idea on what steps to take next?

adaf23ea-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Homeowners insurance - success!,"After a week of research I just bought a new homeowners insurance policy. It's more than I was paying ($300/yr increase), but with peace of mind that the company is cool with me hosting on AirBnB. 

In case this is helpful to you, here is what I learned:

I list half my duplex on AirBnB year-round and live in the other half, so this is a policy for my primary residence. I live in Wisconsin, and policies may vary state-to-state.

The insurance guidance I was getting online and from other hosts was, ""Eh, I'm sure you're fine.""

I don't lose sleep over property damage, but I was uneasy about a worst-case scenario, like a guest burning down my house. 

I told each company I was looking for a homeowners policy that allowed for short term rentals or homesharing.   

Every agent acted like they had never heard the question before and had to look into it before giving me an answer. Twice I heard, ""I think it's OK,"" only to be told in a follow-up, ""Actually, you have to limit it to 14 days a year.""

Here's what I was told:

-- American Family (the policy I had previously) -- My base homeowners policy allowed 62 nights/year of homesharing. Beyond 62 nights requires a $4K+ commercial policy.

-- Travelers Insurance (**what I went with**) -- allows unlimited homesharing with a $215 rider on a homeowners policy

-- American Modern Insurance -- Also allows homesharing, but the quote came in about $600 higher than Travelers

-- State Farm -- Homeowners policy does not cover homesharing beyond a minimal number of days/year.

-- Liberty Mutual -- Homeowners policy does not cover homesharing beyond a minimal number of days/year.

-- Homesite Home Insurance -- This one killed me because I got a really great quote and nearly bought the policy. The agent insisted homersharing was OK, but I pushed to see it in writing. Ultimately I talked with three agents who had three different answers for me. After a week of researching they told me the policy in fact did not cover homesharing.

adaf261a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Update on AirBNB’s ninja refund and lessons learned from this support encounter,"[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/bv42fx/airbnb_support_issues_ninja_refund_for_a_guest/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) happened recently that led me down a path of aggravation with AirBNB. Short version; Lady booked, stayed, then lied about staying to try and get a refund. Tried to cancel the day before checkin, didn’t like the cancellation policy, tried to reschedule booking to reset cancellation window. Told support the living room was flooded, pics didn’t look like room and she was uncomfortable. First Resolution Specialist told me no refund would be issued then did it anyway to shut the lady up. 

After some back and forth with Support and advice from u/dearabby, I changed my argument from “She is lying, she stayed here all night and you can tell just by reading her messages in the app when she arrived and left” to “I don’t give a shit how long she stayed, there is a cancellation policy for a reason” and cited the cancellation policy section covering guest refunds. I received this from Support this morning....

*I do apologize for this kind of situation. Rest assures that I will make things right due to lack of investigation from the case before. No worries about this as we have policies to abide. I will take everything on note and race this feedback to our management so it won't happen again. The cancellation policy is your rights. As this will only be upheld when the cancellation is not on your end and also if it doesn't fall under any circumstances that waived the cancellation policy.*  

Followed by this a little later...

*I hope your well reading this. I apologize that it took this long for the issue to be resolve. We carefully investigate on this matter rest assure that the agent who assisted this case before will undergo right process. I am glad to inform you that we will be giving you the full amount of payout we do apologize for the inconvenience that this caused you. If there would be anything else that I can assist you with please let me know.*

**LESSONS LEARNED** 

Don’t assume the resolution specialist you are dealing with understands or is familiar with their own TOS and policies. I wasted so much time because I got triggered by the audacity of this lady to flat out lie about how long she was here that she got her refund because the first resolution specialist wasn’t familiar with the cancellation policy or didn’t think about it and issued a refund after telling me there would not be one. Again, thanks u/dearabby for pointing me down the path of righteousness. (Username checks out, BTW).

adaf2c96-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Tips for booking a good Airbnb experience and what you should do if things go wrong from an ex Airbnb Case Manager,"So I worked as a Case Manager for Airbnb for over a year and I thought I would post some tips for people.

First and foremost: READ THE LISTING. Read, read, and re-read so you have all of the details and get a good idea of what you're booking. Don't be afraid to contact the host with any additional questions. This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I saw. People would book without reading the fine print, find out the listing was unsuitable, and then they would be at the mercy of the cancellation policy or the host.

DON'T book a listing with little to no reviews or few photos. If it looks sketchy or you get a bad feeling about it after reading the listing, avoid it. I've seen a lot of people get scammed by booking sketchy listings with no reviews. 

Here's what you should do if you arrive at a listing and it is unsatisfactory:

1) DOCUMENT - Take photos, videos, etc. This is necessary for any chance at a good outcome. I cannot tell you how many people don't receive refunds because of a lack of documentation.


2) CONTACT THE HOST - See if they can fix the issues you're experiencing. Do this before calling customer service, as they will recommend you do so before doing anything else. If your host offers to move you to a different listing (many of them will to keep their money) DON'T. Call customer service if the host cannot fix the issue(s). Keep all communication on the Airbnb platform if possible. If this is not possible, make sure you get things in writing and save any text, e-mail, etc., conversations.

Edit: If you do move to another listing, make sure you alter your reservation to reflect this.

3) CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE IMMEDIATELY - DO NOT wait until after your stay to contact customer service. If you do this, their options to help you are much more limited and rely mainly on documentation.

If your reservation is canceled last minute (Airbnb considers this time frame to be within a month of check-in) you have the option of contacting customer service for re-booking assistance. If customer service had to cancel your reservation, a Case Manager should reach out to you to offer assistance. In most situations, you'll be automatically issued a re-booking coupon that will be the amount you originally paid, plus 10% (up to $200). You can get Airbnb to cover more than that 10% within reason (i.e. don't try to book a new listing that's hundreds or thousands of dollars more).

If I think of other things I'll edit this post to add them. Hopefully this is helpful.

adaf2f66-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Misrepresented listing, Airbnb refuses full refund","Hi all, looking for advice on how to proceed with this. It’s a bit long.

My sister and I recently took a trip to Paris and booked an Airbnb to stay in. When we got there, we realized it wasn’t cleaned, nor did the host provide the amenities he’d put on the listing. He hadn’t even bothered to sweep or clean—there was dust and grime on the floor, food crumbs all over the desk, a tomato rotting in the fridge, bed unmade with the comforter just balled up and thrown on top of the bed. Ok, this was minor—we’re not crazy picky and would just wear shoes in the apartment and clean up a bit. Then we realized there wasn’t even a trash can in the whole unit. 

We looked around the whole place and there weren’t any towels, shampoo, or adequate bed linens as he had said would be provided in the listing. There were 2 twin beds for us to sleep in, but he only left one bed cover and one blanket. He’d left two pillows, but no pillowcases...the pillows were stained. 

We contacted the host asking where the towels were, and he said they were in the bathroom...they weren’t. After we told him this, he stopped responding for 5 hours. My sister and I dropped off our stuff and decided to get dinner while we waited for him to respond, then we reached out to Airbnb, who told us to give them an hour to speak to the host. He finally responded to them re: cleaning and towels, saying it was too late in the day to get a cleaners it was 9pm, that he would send one the next day. We asked about the missing amenities and Airbnb said they would ask him to have the cleaner bring those too.

We were using the space as a homebase for the duration of our week stay, and were heading to Amsterdam for the next few days. We asked him if we needed to be there to let the cleaner in since we would be gone, and again, he stopped responding. We spent the night in a hotel nearby. He sent a message the next day when we were in Amsterdam saying that the cleaners came and the towels were there. 

We got back from our trip two days later, to find the place exactly as we had left it. He had lied about sending a cleaner and leaving towels (and hadn’t addressed any of our other concerns either). We reached out to Airbnb again and they asked us to give a minimum of 24 hours to talk to the host, and recommended we stay in a hotel for the night—no offer to help reaccommodate us. It was 1:30am at that point, so we were frantically looking for an affordable last minute place to stay, and wound up spending the rest of our trip in a hotel. 

The last day of our stay (3 days later), the host messaged us asking when we were checking out...we were too frazzled and upset to message him after he had lied to us and were trying to find new accommodation. We were confused that Airbnb had not even been in contact with him, and they didn’t get back to us until we were already heading home that evening. 

They said they considered it a “low severity issue,” and only offered to refund us $100 on the $380 reservation (this is on top of the $410 we spent on hotels). I took it to twitter and was just referred back to the same case manager, who said she was sorry I felt upset and that this was the final decision. 

Not sure how to proceed from here. Any advice would be appreciated!",0.94,42,1541546310.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/9utm5t/misrepresented_listing_airbnb_refuses_full_refund/,True,21

adaf324a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,My AirBnB Host Guarantee Experience,"(TL;DR - Happy Ending)

I've been hosting for 4-5 years now in a ""whole place"" apartment I have. 99% of my guests are fantastic, but you get the occasional dud, right?

I have wall-to-wall carpet and a recent guest, who did not speak English well, managed to stain my mauve carpet and then attempted to clean it with some sort of laundry bleach product, which left permanent white spots (this is despite the fact that I keep a Bissell carpet cleaning machine in the apartment, but as we all know, guests can be oblivious).

She sent me texts and pictures after the fact, telling me what had happened. She even said ""if compensation is needed please let me know.""

So as soon as she left I went in there to look and went over the stains with my carpet cleaning machine. No luck -- the carpet was toast.

I then immediately went to my local carpet store with detailed measurements and got a bid to replace the carpet. I sent this to the guest, but then at that point she told me no way, too bad so sad, etc.

So I immediately called Airbnb, and they very nicely explained and walked me through the process for submitting a claim. At that point I also carefully read through the host guarantee fine print. I submitted my claim the same day, including all her texts and pics that showed the damage and admitted liability, and the replacement estimate. I also let them know that since I have pretty constant guests that I preferred not to have to wait a long time, since I don't want my guests having to look at huge white spots on my carpet.

So about 3 days later Airbnb notified me that they'd honor the claim, but would apply a depreciation value to my carpet, so they ended up giving me a dollar amount that was about 65% of what my estimate was.

I didn't love this but I basically thought it was fair and it certainly was fast.

Once I agreed to this I had to fill out and ""sign"" an online form saying that I accepted everything and was good and it was done and over, etc etc etc. A lot of fine print.

I did that, and then the payout came through the next day.

So all in all a fast and satisfactory experience and I felt like AirBnb was responsive and that the Host Guarantee program worked as it should.

I have no idea if AirBnb pursued the guest for the damages.

And I wrote her a negative review.

They booked around 5:45, and I sent them a message saying I would be home in an hour -- no response. Half an hour later, I get a phone call from the guest, visiting from China, saying that she and her family were waiting in the lobby. I get home, and they are not there-- went out to get dinner at a restaurant.

I hurry back, and bring two of them in (it's a private room booking w/ 2 beds) immediately, they start looking surprised and disappointed that I am also in the apartment. They thought they were getting an oceanfront condo in a major city for $60.

After deliberating for about 10 minutes in the room, they announce they're going to leave, and that their in-laws will arrive soon and stay in the room. I should have just said no, but it was late, and frankly, I just wanted to go to bed. MIL and FIL arrive, speaking no English. They also have no phones, the the original guest wanted to know if she could call me to get to them (ie. use my cell phone), to which I said no. She then wanted to know if their extended family could come have breakfast here in the morning ""between 4-12 people"". Again, I said no, the guest made a face, and then left with the only guest key so that she could return in the morning.

adaf3538-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Stayed at ""secluded"" cabin. Found cameras","Hi all, my wife and I for our anniversary this year rented a cabin in the mountains for the weekend to relax and enjoy the quiet. We specifically wanted a cabin with a fire pit and hot tub. When we arrived everything looked good except for the tub was basically set to the lowest temperature which made it unusable for the first half of our stay. We were getting in the tub the next day and I noticed some video cameras hidden up in the ceiling of the porch/patio area. One was pointed at the fire pit and seating area while the other was pointing out to the hot tub. No cameras were disclosed in the listing or by the packet issued by the property management company (its a privately owned cabin who has a management company rent it out through thier own website as well as airbnb and I assume other means as well). This cabin is also not listed as having internet service but in the master bedroom a DSL router was clearly very busy as well as there being a private wifi network. I can only assume that those cameras were streaming which is disturbing to me. As it was advertised as a secluded cabin the wife and I decided that we did not need a bathing suit for the hot tub and did not use any (house rules did not say anything about this). We are now feeling very violated and are unsure what to do about this.

My initial reaction upon being informed of the review was one of concern. I thought perhaps the pet cat had done damage since I had checked out.

See the review here:

'Seriously? I read all the reviews about Shane leaving accommodations tidy, and my experience is the TOTAL opposite. I just arrived home to find furniture and decor moved, towels thrown all over the bathroom, and food scraps and rubbish on my kitchen counter and floor. My home was spotless before they arrived and the way it was left was totally disgusting and disrespectful. I had even been nice enough to agree to a late checkout (4 hours late!!) so they can’t claim that they had no time to clean or at least put everything back to where they’d moved it from. I would NEVER host Shane or his guest again. This is up there with one of the worst AirBnB experiences I’ve ever had!! I’d feel just as violated as if my home had been broken into and trashed.'

adaf3ad8-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guests - do you care about cities being ruined by AirBnB?,"I have used AirBnB quite a bit when I’ve been on holiday but have noticed a real decline in properties - much more commercial full time operations rather than the original idea of spending time with a host/renting a spare room/a owner making a bit of cash while they are away. 
I live in Edinburgh and it’s a serious problem here - huge areas of the city being bought up by rich landlords, turning whole blocks of flats into full AirBnB blocks. No one lives in them for any part of the year and they are just rented on short term let’s to tourists all year round. It’s pushed up rents and house prices out of the affordable range of younger buyers, making whole areas of the city unliveable for locals. 
It’s really made me reconsider how I use AirBnB/if I use it at all. I try to pick houses that actually benefit a single owner, or where I will meet and have an interaction with the host.

The worst was the housekeeper who barged in a day early, without knocking, and stood there, while I was half dressed on the couch and told me I needed to be out in 15 minutes. I told her she was wrong and she continued that I was on her list. I’m sure she is grossly mistreated and underpaid by her Vacasa-slum overlords so I guess I just took the brunt of her frustration.

adaf3dc6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Airbnb customer service is atrocious," 

Airbnb has the worst customer support I have ever experienced. After booking accommodation for a large group trip 5 months in advance, I realized the second half of the home charge did not come through 2 weeks before the trip. I decided to call to make sure that our reservation was indeed still confirmed at which point I was told that I had canceled it with no evidence whatsoever that this was the case and that I would not be getting my money back for the first charge. The Airbnb representative then tried to convince me to book another place with the same host instead of taking any culpability for canceling my reservation and refused to issue me a refund. After several more unanswered exchanges and hours of calls, another Airbnb representative again told me that I was the one who had canceled the reservation and even mistakenly sent me a message on the platform saying “adv that we can't cancel reso's so nicely I told him that had to have been him or a user on the acct.” Finally, I got someone to actually do some digging and realized that Airbnb did, in fact, trigger the cancellation of my reservation. At this point, it took THREE additional weeks for them to back to me to say they were going to issue me a refund.

I had spent 15 hours on the phone with representatives telling me that I was wrong. I had had several emails go unanswered. I had to book a new house through VRBO at the last second. And literally, all Airbnb provided me was a refund on the money for the house that they had canceled on me 2 weeks before my trip. No apology. No additional compensation. 

While I’m sure many people will continue to use the service - as I did before this experience - I would strongly discourage anyone from doing so and caution that at some point you will have to deal with Airbnb’s customer service and it is worse than any airline you’ve ever encountered and will not end well.",0.86,42,1556409241.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/bi58u3/airbnb_customer_service_is_atrocious/,True,24

From the 67 enquiries I have received this month

1) 19 people have opened with either 'Do you have a pool?' or 'Can we use the pool'?

My listing has 'pool' in the title, mentions the pool in the first line of the summary, lists the pool rules in the house rules and includes several pictures of the pool.

Why do people need to ask if I have one? Why do the people who realise I have one think I would mention it if they couldn't use it?

2) 6 people have asked if I can drop the charge for extra guests and have eight people stay for the price of one guest.

No, my listing is supposed to make me money. If I do that it would cost me money.

One of these was particularly ridiculous.

Her: Your place is definitely big enough for all eight of us. You only have four beds though. How are eight people supposed to be able to sleep here?

Me: Each of the beds can comfortably fit two guests.

Her: None of us like sharing beds. Can you buy four more for us?

Me: No.

Her: If you won't buy extra beds, can you just let us pay the price for one guest then? It's not fair to charge for eight if we won't each get our own bed.

Me: Hosting eight of you for the price of one would cost me money. It sounds like this place isn't suitable for you. You're better off booking eight beds in a hostel if you want a bed each and aren't willing to pay much.

3) 5 people have asked either asked for a check in 7+ hours before my check-in time, a check-out time 8+ hours after my check out time or both.

One guest wanted to check in at 03:00 on a Tuesday, then check out at 01:00 on a Thursday and only pay for one night.

When I told them that they would have to pay for three nights, I was told that this wasn't fair as they would only be sleeping Tuesday night.

4) 4 people have asked if they can bring along 10+ people for a pool party and only pay for one guest as only one will be sleeping.

My house rules state no parties and make it clear that guests using the pool have to be paid for whether they enter our unit or not.

5) One guy did all of the above and proceeded to ask a bunch of other stupid questions such as:

'Why are there stairs?' - The guy had already asked about the number of bedrooms, could clearly see that the beds weren't cluttering up the common space and that there were no doors other than the front door downstairs. Where exactly did he think think the bedrooms were?

'Why don't you provide food and drink?'

'Can we view the place tomorrow and collect the key then?' - His booking was over a month away. I suspect he planned on burgling the place, then cancelling to get a refund.

etc.
___________
In all, that's over half of our requests that have been stupid questions.

Plus another 7 of the remaining 33 have asked for our full address up front. I tell guests nearby landmarks when they ask this, even though they can already see this via the map.

I also had a girl ask me how long it would take her to travel to about five different locations (she asked one at a time rather than all at once), all of which were in more or less the same place.

adaf50d6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,AirBnB should add a camera function to their app,"It can work for both guests and hosts:

#Guests: 

As soon as you check in, you open the AirBnB app and record a video of the property. Any damages you see can be recorded as proof you did not cause them. 

Also before checking out, you would do the same. The app can ""upload"" the video with the time stamp it's saved since it's officially been recorded within the AirBnB app.

Most hosts have WiFi so this could work (avoiding extra data usage).

#Hosts:

You can also record the property before a guest arrives and after if there are any damages. If a conflict occurs, AirBnB can compare the two views.


All this can be optional, but if one side of the party fails to record during their given time period - they forfeit their right to dispute.

The app can give a window of time when you're able to record the check in and check out time period. For example when a guest checks in, they must record it within 2 hours. 



#Backstory:
 I had a host claim I broke a bunch of stuff on their property when it was clear the items broken were done by the previous guests. The host was conveniently on vacation during the other person's stay. They came back in time to see the place only after *we* had checked out. There were minor things like broken towel racks, a broken chair outside, broken appliances, etc. We paid no attention and thought ""oh well, these were broken before us. the host probably knows"". I should have recorded something on my own. Long story short, I was able to prove it wasn't us but it was a long hassle and the host left an awful review for me.

adaf5248-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,On not hosting seniors,"More of a rant than anything here, but would enjoy some opinions on hosting seniors and how to avoid being overly  discriminatory in listing descriptions and house rules.

I have an older woman staying four nights.  I am very clear upfront that the house is shared and home to a large male country dog.  I warn upfront there will be occasional barking and anytime you occupy the common spaces on the main floor, the dog will be present.  He lives here, you don't, if you want to stay this is a simple fact and I will hear no dog related complaints.  The dog is awesome, btw.  People love him and he loves people.

This women hates my dog, which is sad because she booked specifically because he was mentioned in the ad, ""I love all dogs and I hope I can spend some time with your dog during my visit.""

First complaint, ""dog doesn't like her.""  ""Dog doesn't sit when I tell him""  ""Dog barked""  ""Dog barked"" ""Dog barked""  I calmly reply that yes, he barks sometimes, dogs bark.  This is the country, see that chipmumk over there?  The dog barks at it, its fun, sometimes he chases it too.  She tells me this is unacceptable.  I say again, this is a house with a barking dog, accept it or depart.  (btw, my dog barks maybe 10 actual woofs a day, mostly when cars pull into the laneway.  This is his job.)

Then the stairs.  Simple flight of stairs, well lit, sturdy, easy peasy.  Jesus christ it's like I'm asking her to run a marathon.  Again, clearly mentioned all guests rooms on the second floor. Complain complain, whiney old white lady voice complain.

Breakfast is included here, and again people love the breakfasts.  Full-on hot breakfast served with a fucking smile and coffee.  Complain complain complain.  Who the fuck can't eat any fibre but neglects to mention this until they sit down to eat?  And really, my choice of 1% milk offends you?   

I want to grab her by the throat and sceam I'M A FUCKING SUPERHOST YOU DRIED UP OLD CUNT NOW FUCKING JUST ENJOY YOUR STAY LIKE 100s OF OTHERS HAVE BEFORE YOU.  But of course, I'm trying to be as positive and cooperative as possible.  

This morning, as she is readying to depart for the day she advised me quite sternly that I need to get rid of my dog if I wish to continue operating a bed and breakfast.  I replied, ""no, I will just no longer allow seniors to stay.""  She seemed quite upset, but at this point I hope she just breaks a hip while sightseeing and never comes back.  I know I'm stuck trying to be nice to this self-entitled c-nt of a women for three more nights.  I don't host many older people, however the ones I have hosted are non stop complainers about everything.  I don't have patience for them, or the desire to cater to their needs. 

**
Is this a possibility?  Upper age restrictions?  Or possibly a warning that ""able bodied individuals with no special health or dietary issues only please.""   How would a host go about politely stating that unsolicited advice, nitpicking, and general bitchiness    will not be tolerated?  **

adaf53b0-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,[Update] Currently 7am and host is blasting music and drinking with her friends,"So we left the airbnb as soon as we finished breakfast after the night of the storm.

It was a long and painful journey but thankfully Lindsey from Airbnb was on our side.

With her help, a trip that could have turned into a nightmare became the journey of a lifetime.

If you didn't see the original post then you should take a look [here.](http://imgur.com/a/3rzom)

I'll recap the story for everyone. We booked a private airbnb in the city of Montreal. When we arrived (12am due to traffic and finding parking) everything seemed great. Wifi was fast, place was very open and the balcony was beautiful. 

However, the happiness slowly faded once this random guy comes out of this room. There are 2 rooms in the house. A tiny little shower and a room that's split in 2 by a tiny little bedsheet. Originally, we weren't too bothered by the weird rooming accommodation but we were pretty annoyed when her friends started coming over.

We left for the club at 12am that night. We would've stayed longer but the host had invited 5 other random guys over. Not only was our private room not private at all, there were strangers going through our stuff, entering our rooms, etc. The place has no locks and tons of bob marley posters, think hippie hideaway.

Now we get back from the club and the hostess decided to bring out her blow up bed. This bed completely blocks the bathroom. There's a random guy sleeping on a bench beside the bed in the kitchen. There's a random guy on the hammock outside and there's another random guy sleeping in the room behind the sheet. For some reason, the hostess was sleeping on the air bed.

Anyways, we figure things out and get to bed. Only to be woken up at 7am by her music and laughing. They were fucking drinking and screaming at 7 fucking AM. The best part was that at one point they disappeared and we thought that we would have been able to sleep. Unfortunately, they came back 10 minutes later with more booze. I think I made my post around this time.

I put on headphones, wrap my eyes with a bandana and tried to force myself to sleep. The next day, my friend, who was sleeping in the other room said that we have to fucking leave. I was confused since I thought that while it was bad, it wasn't that bad. I had yet to learn that from the hours of 7ish - 10ish, the hostess was having sex with one of the guys in the room behind the curtain. My friend also mentioned that after the sex, the guy comes through the hanging sheet stark naked and decides to pee in our take out container in the corner of the room.

Needless to say, we went to a cafe for breakfast and called airbnb from there. We got all our stuff out and for 4 - 6 hours, we were wandering the streets. 90% of airbnbs and hotels that Lindsey (airbnb agent) sent were booked since there were numerous events in the city. This is when Lindsey came in clutch and provided us with a free $700 upgrade.

These guests are by far not the worst I've had, and they seem relatively decent for the most part, just entitled.

They arrived at my house at 3am, woke me up after I clearly sent them the electronic door code. Second we have a dog that we make clear we have, on top of that we have many reviews saying our dog is their favorite part of the stay. They show up and state they are scared/allergic to dogs and request I have my dog somewhere else. Lastly on our communication it is ok only one person, both our rooms are empty, one is cheaper, so I offer the larger room to her. Turns out there are two people and they use both rooms, but only pay for one.

Also, is it standard to have locks on bedroom doors? I've grown up all my life with no locks, and I have been in other Airbnb with no locks so I never thought that was an issue.

Update: they checked out just now, said they felt scared eith no locks, which is valid, but they didnt have the courtesy to properly close the door on the way out, it was left open.

Update: it was out of my control, but they are staying the remainder of the nights, I guess they we nice and polite about accepting extra charges.

adaf595a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,I think my AirBnB host is scamming me,"This is my first time using AirBnB and it’s been a fiasco. 

So I’m renting this apartment for 10 days with my boyfriend, everything seems all good. 

First issue was that the guidelines said we should receive check in info the day before our arrival. We did not. Day of, we didn’t receive them either. I tried to contact my host but could not get through even with multiple messages and phone calls. I called AirBnB and they weren’t too helpful. 

We FINALLY get in contact with the host and we manage to get to our place. The room is filthy, it hadn’t been cleaned AT ALL from the last guests. They put us up for the night in a room down the hall which seems fine. The place would be cleaned for the next day. 

The next day the apartment still hasn’t been cleaned at all. We contact the host through the emergency number and manage to get a cleaning person in who does little more than change the sheets and take out the garbage. The bathtub edge was covered in shaved off hair from the last guests. 

The host also lied about the bed size on the posting, saying it was a queen when it was clearly a double. My boyfriend is very tall so a big bed was a selling point for me. 

Also our host on AirBnB was posing as a Québécois woman but when I called it was a South Asian man who picked up and claimed to be the host. 

Everything seems ok now but then our fridge breaks. We contact the host as soon as we notice, but it takes a couple days for them to get back to us. The send a repair guy over to try to fix it but it still isn’t working. 

A couple days later my boyfriend and I are sitting on the couch and we notice someone unlocking the door. It’s a private apartment so we were both scared. I unlock the door and two ladies are there and ask “do you live here?” And I said no, that I’m renting it from AirBnB. They say ok and then just leave. 

We’ve currently been here 8 days and our fridge is still barely working, the freezer is barely cold enough to work as a fridge. 

Me and my boyfriend decide to go for a hike and I look for my runners. We end up searching absolutely everywhere for them and they can’t be found at all. I go down the hall and ask the people who stayed there after us if they’ve seen them, they haven’t. 

I message the AirBnB manager and they have said to me that the room was cleaned before we got there and the only people who were in the apartment besides me and my boyfriend were the two ladies who showed up, apparently from building management. I told him off saying that 1) no our room was absolutely not clean when we got there and 2) the ladies literally didn’t step foot inside unless it was without our knowledge. 

I’m at my wits end. He gave us 20% off our total room fee, but honestly that isn’t good enough. This is my first time using AirBnB and I don’t know if I’ll ever use it again. 

So what should I do?

Edit: Thanks so much for the advice everyone! I've told airbnb and emailed the CITQ. Also we just got an eviction notice and legal action against the person who owns the apartment ahaha.",0.9,43,1565817685.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/cqg43o/i_think_my_airbnb_host_is_scamming_me/,True,25
adaf5ac2-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Host's flatmates asking me to do chores,"I am renting a room on a medium-term basis (1 week into a 1-month stay). The room itself is lovely but it's in a student flat that's typical of the poorly-maintained student flat style: mould in the shower room, greasy kitchen, washing up left undone for some time etc. (there were no pictures of the common spaces in the listing). I'm fairly laid back wrt cleanliness so I'm not too bothered about this, although it's a bit of a step back for me as I've been graduated a few years and now live with my partner.

The host isn't in the flat while I'm here (the room I'm renting is her bedroom) but her 4 flatmates are around—they know I am subletting but I don't know if they're aware it's through airbnb in particular. I don't really have the time or energy to use the common spaces beyond making dinner (I am working 9 to 5 while here and don't intend to socialise—I have mild social anxiety which makes this unnecessarily stressful).

Tonight one of the people living here told me she'd add me to a group chat for arranging chores. I didn't expect to have to be involved in this and I believe I'm right in thinking it's not typically expected of airbnb guests. I am cleaning up after myself as I would do in any airbnb, but getting involved in collective chore duties seems to be a step beyond that. The price I am paying for the room is definitely a lot more than this room would cost to let normally; I don't want to make this about money but this does make me question why I am paying the higher airbnb prices if I'm being considered a tenant for these purposes.

Any advice on dealing with this would be appreciated. I don't think anyone is acting in bad faith here (they are students, the host is inexperienced, her flatmates may not know I'm here through airbnb) but I don't feel that this is what I signed up for based on previous airbnb experiences.

*Edit*: sorted! I messaged the host and she's let her flatmate know that I am staying through airbnb and only expected to clean up after myself.",0.95,43,1563060883.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/ccw3tk/hosts_flatmates_asking_me_to_do_chores/,True,12

The listing said I’d have a private room and privacy. I have experienced neither and want to know what action I can take.

I can admit that I am messy, but I don’t think that it is appropriate for her to go through my dirty clothes and things.

The only way I’m messy is leaving a yoga mat out and leaving worn - not specifically dirty - clothes on the floor of my private room. I keep shared spaces clean.

Things that she also listed as being disrespectful to her property:
1) me leaving “wet and bacteria filled clothes” on the floor because it will make her carpet smell. While I understand that in terms of underwear, I work 7-5 at a desk and only leave clothes on the floor if they are still fairly clean. They have never even smelled. I don’t sweat often seeing as I sit at a desk.
2) me shaking salt over food because some salt bounces and gets on the counter. I need to now shake salt over the sink.
3) leaving “a few crumbs” on two separate counters. I don’t even understand how she can tell whose crumbs are whose.
4) leaving water bottles on the bed while I’m at work (they are closed)

Instead of telling me these things she has just been criticizing me and cleaning up. I told her I don’t feel comfortable going into my room and she told me all of these problems with me. She told me that i am too messy and if I ever work in a corporate job this wouldn’t fly. 

I hate going home at night. She says rude and critical things to me. She touches my stuff which I see as a HUGE problem. She talks to me while im in the bathroom or have my door closed. She makes comments about highly personal things. I’ve had about enough.

So she hasn’t been communicating her problems and has been criticizing me instead. She has been encroaching on my privacy WHEN SHE SAID ORIGINALLY THAY SHED NEVER NEED TO GO INTO MY ROOM AND WOULDNT GO IN!!!!!!

adaf5d9c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Nightmare in Montreal,"I had debated posting about this as I do not like to use social media to gripe, complain, or do anything other than keep it positive. However, as I have many friends that travel as extensively as I do, I wanted to make people aware of a recent Airbnb issue that I had, and the company’s reaction to it. 

So, here is what happened: My brother and I were in Montreal for our other brother’s bachelor party. There were 13 of us total on this trip. My brother  had rented an Airbnb for the two of us, as the other 11 people were staying in another location (and it was going to be too crowded for another two of us there). We rented the Airbnb in his name for a total of three nights – checking in on Thursday and out on Sunday. The first two nights went by with no issue. It was a nice, clean apartment in a good area. 

On Saturday, we all went out for the day, and then all headed back to our apartments to prepare for the large final dinner for my brothers bachelor party. We arrived back at our apartment at around 6:20 PM. I went to the store across the street, and my brother went up to the apartment alone. As he walked down the hall, he could hear voices inside our apartment, and he knew something was wrong. He put the key in and opened the door and as he did there was a younger (early twenties) guy standing right at the door, along with a stocky guy with a beard near him. Behind him he see three girls around the kitchen counter – doing hair and makeup. He says to them, “what are you all doing in my apartment”. The young man says “we have this apartment tonight”. He told him he didn’t and that we had it until we checked out on Sunday 6/9. He pulled out his phone and showed my brother the Airbnb listing, along with the check in instructions – which all did match the apartment. In hindsight, what he did not see were the dates that he was supposed to have the unit. He asked how they got a key and the guy said that our landlord gave it to him. My brother said great, let’s call her. As soon as my brother said that he walked out the door and acted like he was on a phone call (my brother had been holding the door) . About this same time, I walked back in and my brother made me aware of the situation. He called the contact for our rental unit and explained the situation and she confirmed that we were the only renters of the unit for this time period. She asked him to ask for the name of the other people who supposedly rented the place and NONE of the girls (the guys had both split at this point) knew his name and were unable to reach him by phone. He handed his phone to one of the girls and she began to speak French with our rental contact. She handed the phone back and said that our rental contact was on her way. 

At this point my brother went to his bedroom to see if my items had been disrupted and immediately saw that my AirPods were missing. At this time he called the police and explained the situation and asked them to send a car. At this time he went downstairs to meet . During the time he was on the street I had been talking with the girls, and what I put together is that one of them worked with one of the guys and had paid him $300 to rent this apartment for her birthday party. 

Eventually the contacts for our rental (not the owners – just employees of the owners) showed up. They spoke with the girls and (I think as some of it was in French) told them they had to leave. While they were talking to the girls, my brother and I looked through our possessions to ensure nothing else was missing - and fortunately it was only the AirPods that were gone.  We explained to our rental contract that we no longer felt safe in the apartment and wanted to stay somewhere else , at which time they suggested my brother call AirBnB.  He was on that call for 33 minutes.  After being placed on multiple holds with conversations that were going nowhere, we decided to get a hotel. As this was F1 weekend in Montreal, there were almost no hotels available at all. We found a Marriott at the Montreal Airport and booked two rooms. We called an Uber and we left for the hotel. 

A few key things of note:
• While my brother was on the phone with Airbnb the maintenance guy came by to change the locks and made a statement about having to change the locks weeks ago as well. 
• The entire time this was going on, the girls were still there doing their hair and makeup. It was the oddest scenario. Even when we left to go to the hotel the girls were still there going hair and makeup – like for an hour and half of this going on. 
• One of the girls made a statement that her co-worker that she had rented the apartment from had told her that he was in the apartment on Friday as well – which means that same guy entered our home while we were gone that day. 
• We were immediately refunded the rent for the night that night only.
• The Montreal Police never showed up in the hour and a half that I was there. I understand that this was an event weekend, but that was inexcusable in my book. Not Airbnb’s problem, I understand.  With this, we were never able to file a police report. Essentially we’re talking about a home invasion & they never showed up.
• One of the girls had a picture on her phone of the guy IN the apartment from some time ago – so this guy had been coming there before for sure. 

This all could have been prevented if the Airbnb owners were more diligent about access and security. The use of keypads on doors is extremely common in this industry – many of which have the capability to have the code changed remotely for each guest. 

This situation absolutely ruined this trip. We were unable to go to the big final dinner with everyone to celebrate our brother due to having to be at the apartment to deal with this.

My brother reached out to Airbnb and requested some refunds/reimbursements based on this experience. After a series of what appeared to be automated responses, they finally started replying. Their replies were dismissive and unhelpful and basically ended with “you were refunded for the night that you did not stay there, and that is the most that we are going to do”. There was also no further attempt by the owners of the unit to communicate with us or remedy this situation as well.

The only thing that would indicate that I have a disability is my grainy Airbnb profile picture. \[Description: I'm standing on a beach boardwalk, and I am using a forearm crutch on each arm. \]

&#x200B;

Anyways, I sent in a booking request which got accepted by the host. I didn't check my Airbnb account for a few days, in the span of which the host took it upon himself to cancel the reservation (with no illusions that it was anything EXCEPT due to seeing my profile picture - nowhere else did I mention my disability), and then send me a...weird message about it post-cancellation.

I’ve had a decent amount of success finding cabins that are truly isolated. But I wouldn’t mind finding a house with a pool or some other nice lavish situation to treat myself to. 

But simply filtering my searches to “entire house” doesn’t really yield the results I’m looking for.  I get mostly guest houses, duplexes. Things where the owner or other guests are still in the area or on the property. And half the time I have to deep dive the entire listing and photo album to figure out I probably won’t be alone.

It’s so pervasive that I feel like I need to contact the hosts and just confirm that I’ll be the only living soul on the property during my stay. And let’s face it that request makes me sound a little shady. Nothing puts a Host at easy quite like a potential guest asking “and you or anyone else will absolutely not be there to keep an eye on me?”. When all I really want is an introverts dream vacation of complete solitude. 

Any tips for finding what I’m looking for with more consistency?",0.89,41,1555654619.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/bevxn1/whats_the_best_way_to_search_for_houses_that_are/,True,28
adaf64cc-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,My stomach cringes writing a bad guest review...,"Ive been a host for a long time, since Airbnb was first available in our area, and Ive never really written a bad guest review. Sometimes I will not review a guest that was particularly messy or just knock down a star, and it is usually the case they don't review either. But I have recently been rethinking my approach to guest reviews, and feel that future hosts need to know the truth about these guests, even if it makes my stomach hurt to do it. 

My current dilemma, three guests in their 40s stayed at our place and everything seemed great, but after they left we found multiple broken glasses and a HUGE coffee stain on our floor, it was coffee with milk and reeked as if it had been there for days, there was obviously no attempt to clean it up and it has left a terrible stain. Now these things happen, spills and broken dishes, I just wished they had told us! Here I was with a carpet shampooer one hour before our next guest arrived!

Then literally the next guests, booked for 5 adults, and obviously had children as all our guest resource literature had been scribbled all over, diapers left in bathroom, etc. and they had put back all the dishes dirty, I had to rewash every single one, literally food stuck on them etc. Now this has happened before with other guests, except the big kicker was someone had destroyed our succulent vase (i am guessing it was the child). They were cherished plants that take a very long time to grow and they had been destroyed! If I had known children were staying I would have put them away or out of reach. So it was just upsetting, all they would have to do is tell us and I would have felt better about it, but what a terrible surprise.

&#x200B;

Anyways, maybe these seem like insignificant things, and I feel horrible leaving a bad review, like literally sick to my stomach at the thought... so any feedback?

adaf690e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Rant: The Acceptance Requirement is ridiculous,"I recently noticed that my acceptance rate of requests is being tracked, and that you need to keep it above 88%.   I’m currently running about 89%, which makes me nervous.   I do about 400ish bookings per year.
I’m not an unreasonable person, and accept requests from anyone who doesn’t have prior bad reviews, or will agree specifically via message to my terms.   I also have instant book on, so as long as the guest is verified and has good reviews, they’re in!  But so often I get requests that I have to reject, guests requesting to have more people than the room can hold, or guests with pets (I have a no pet rule).   It seems, well, unfair that I’m penalized for declining those requests.

Today I receive a request from a man.   His previous review, from this month, mentioned a horrible mess left, including carpet stains, blood stains on the bed and blankets, and three garbage cans worth of trash in the room.    Again, it seems unfair that I’m penalized for rejecting a request like this.

adaf6c10-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"My experience with third party middle man, Pillow.","For those that don't know Pillow Residential is a middle man service that coordinates activity and funds for hosts that live in Airbnb friendly buildings. For instance I rent an apartment in a high rise and the management has declared the building to be Airbnb friendly. The lease states that I may use the Pillow software to run an Airbnb listing and I will be compliant with my lease. Pillow takes a cut of the earnings and shares it with the building. We all walk away with a gain.

They first made their appearance in our building by hosting a meet and greet party to explain their service and how it works. The sales pitch revolved primarily around local statistics such as hotel fees and abundance of growth in the area. The basic tone of the evening was ""There is a lot of money to be made here, and we're here to show you how to do it!"" They also mention that the amount of days you are allowed to run a listing will be at the discretion of the building management, which at the time was to be determined.

At first glance the terms seem pretty reasonable, 25&#37; of your earnings will be taken away from you and given to the building management. Obviously Pillow takes a share of this fee and that is how they make their money. When asked about tax time however the president of Pillow and host of the party Sean Conway didn't have much to say. Thankfully I was prepared for Uncle Sam because I am already an experienced Airbnb user with Super Host status. What Sean and the Pillow website fail to tell you is that you need to set another 20-25&#37; of your earnings away for tax time. I mean why would you share that in your sales pitch? It really does sound awful, I don't blame him.

Due to the logistics of my current living situation I saw this as a good opportunity to offset the cost of my living expenses and upon writing this rant I still do. So I take my existing Super Host of an account and I sign up with Pillow. After filling out my basic information they prompt you to import all of your existing settings into their system with a quick yes or no option and of course I say yes to this. These settings are the delicate ecosystem that allow you to stream line your Airbnb schedule around your personal life and they are essential.

Pillows website informs you that the process of conversion may take a few hours, so naturally I leave it alone and go on to do other things. Later that day I get a notification on my phone telling me that I already have a booking. Upon further inspection I come to find out that not a single setting from my listing had been copied over and my calendar had defaulted back to its basic $100 a night price with instant book turned on! So now I'm getting an influx of bookings from people with 0 reviews at a price way below its value. In order to correct this I turn off my listing and I have to call Airbnb to cancel the undesirable bookings and beg them not to effect my Super Host status. By the way one cancellation on my end will end my Super Host status for the next 3 months, essentially removing my street cred from the community.

After cleaning up the mess I go back to my account to put everything back together and I learn that the majority of the important features that I rely on are locked out and they want me to use the features on the Pillow website instead. I'm not very pleased about this because the Airbnb website has a bunch of creature comforts that the Pillow website just doesn't have. I decide to explore every square inch of Pillows website and I come to find that there isn't a feature to turn off instant book. I go to the appropriate section under the Airbnb website and I find that the instant book settings are now grayed out and no longer accessible. I got from both the horses mouths at Airbnb and Pillow that ""this is the direction Airbnb is moving with 3rd party subscribers and I should still be able to at least set some controls with-in instant book."" That information would have been really nice to know at the beginning of the process, SEAN FOUNDER AND CEO OF PILLOW! So not only has my account been stripped naked and sent to fend for itself on the internet it has been declawed by intentionally removing the instant book toggle and locking me out of its features! I am beyond furious!

Pillows website has a chat feature that allows you to chat with help. For the most part they respond in a timely manner, but they aren't any help. Once it was suggested to me that they would cancel the booking for me and pay the fine for me ($50 per cancellation) which would have been fine if I didn't care about my Super Host status. When I asked about my status the tech washed his hands of me by saying ""We do not have control over the Airbnb Super Host status."" I was then met with unresponsive silence from the chat window when I continued on with my concern. So once they say their piece and wash their hands of you they feel that the matter is solved and you have to open up another ticket in order to get some help. Calling Airbnb wasn't much help either. I was able to escalate the matter beyond the first line of defense with the Super Host help hotline, but I have yet to get a response back. What I find even more disturbing is that I had to chat with 3 different people on the Pillow website before I could get a straight answer as to whether or not it was Pillows intent to indeed strip its users of the instant book settings. The official answer I finally got was ""Yes, we want you to have control over your bookings. We're providing you with everything we're able to with what Airbnb has provided us."" which in my opinion is still pretty vague considering that there is an Instant book setting, and there are settings WITHIN instant book.

A lot of finger pointing at Airbnb and a lot of vague answers, which leads me to believe that none of the chat help actually knows what goes on within the realm of their website. The final verdict I got out of them was that they intend to provide a quality product but for now if a booking doesn't meet my standards then I can call Airbnb and explain my situation so that I may protect my status as a Super Host. I will have to do this every time.

So that's it, after a bunch of harassment to both companies this is where I am at. I can take on all of the extra work that Pillow has dumped on my lap by hijacking my listing and ruining the settings or I can just take a gamble on every single booking that has 0 reviews, and right now that has been every single one of my requests since switching over to Pillow.

Sean CEO and founder of Pillow if you're reading this, how dare you. How dare you take my hard earned credibility and rape it with your inferior product. You should be ashamed of the information you withheld from your user base. You should be ashamed at the quality of your technical support. I completely blame you for knowing that this problem existed and still silently allowing it to run its course, letting your users find out for themselves the hard way. Is this really how you are going to treat the people that you depend on to pay your salary?

I went for a walk and upon returning, the host commented on my pot belly (I had a mini pot, I'm not overweight for my height but am skinny fat.   She said walking is good, but diet is more important (she's right).

adaf7a48-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,An AirBnB host asked me not to negatively review their property,"I don’t really know if I’m looking for advice or just to vent but I had a very strange experience with an Airbnb last night that I wanted to share here. 

My father booked the apartment and I skimmed the listing and thought it looked nice. It was advertised as “CITY NAME- beachfront property with parking” in the listing it suggested that parking was on premises and provided the basics (toiletries, heating, etc) 

The first red flag was raised when I realized that despite “CITY NAME” being a prominent part of the listing it was actually located in a small town just outside the city. No big deal, we have a car and if I paid more attention I would have notice that. But as I read the extensive message sent by the host  on our drive there I realized that parking was actually about a 5 minute walk away. The host made sure to mention how lucky we were to even have this parking even though she stated that it was on the premises in the listing. The tone was very much “you should feel lucky that you’re getting parking, you’re welcome”

When we finally got to the street the apartment is on we realize that not only is it very much not “beachfront” it’s actually located quite far from the beach. 


Then we walked in the house and it was FREEZING cold. There was no toilet paper, soap, or toiletries of any kind. I immediately called the host who told me I would have to turn on 2 heating units. When I asked where the heater for the second bedroom was she said “it’s not heated. It’s usually not this cold here” 

Then I asked about the toiletries and she said the cleaning lady must have forgot. My response was “Ok so what should we do?”  to which the host replied “there are many markets in the town” she then dove into a long speech about how we have to be careful with using the heaters because they will cause the power to go out and what we need to do when that happens. 

We pumped the heat in the house and waited for my dad to return from parking the car. He informed us that the parking lot was a 7 minute uphill walk on completely unlit streets with no sidewalks. After about an hour of blasting the heat full force the house was still not even warm and the lights were flickering so hard I knew it was a only a matter of time until the power went out. 

The unheated room was SO cold and the mattresses were so uncomfortable that we knew we couldn’t last one night let alone 3.

I contacted the host with my concerns and she immediately responded that it was no problem and we could have a full refund. She offered to let us stay the night for free or even sleep at her home if we couldn’t find an alternative for the night. She felt really genuine to me so I stayed cordial and thanked her profusely for her help. 

But then she messaged me and asked me not to leave a negative review. The listing is back up on the site with all of the false information and I just feel weird about it knowing someone else could find themselves in the same situation as we did. She also has no reviews on Airbnb so I’m wondering if this happens often. 

Edit: we can’t review the place since we cancelled the booking. Maybe I went about this the wrong way? I cancelled then requested money from her which she gave. I’d love to let others know since the whole thing was so sketchy but I’m not sure how. 

Edit 2: from what people are saying it looks like we CAN review the property even though we cancelled. I do not use Airbnb so I was taking my dad/users here word for it. Tomorrow I’ll look into it on my dad’s phone but for now I’ve reported the listing to Airbnb. Thanks for all of your advice and help!

Edit 3: there seems to be some major confusion about this so I thought I’d clear it up. When a guest cancels they CAN leave a review but not until about 24 hours after the cancellation.

I did my best to verify this was a manager and she had compelling evidence. I then informed them that I was using the apartment for an Airbnb and they told me I couldn’t stay here and that the host had been evicted. She eventually let me go to the room to at least get my stuff and when I was packing I chatted with the host who wanted me to fight it and call the police and said she was calling the police. When the landlord/manager eventually came back she said she was going to call the police and I would be in trouble for trespassing.

adaf7e76-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Ridiculous review by guest.[LAUGHING RANT],"I just had to share my latest 3 star review (I've only had 3 in several years of hosting). I knew this guy was going to give me a bad review, because he clearly hadn't read the listing and had ridiculous expectations. 

His review [with my comments]:

1) The location is near to China town and Korea town and the bus is convenient. So it may be a good choice for tourists who plan to explore the city. [In his private feedback he said the location wasn't good for him because it was far away from his conference. The location circle is centered *exactly* on my house, why didn't he book somewhere closer to his conference?] 

2) Based on my experience, the room is quiet but not very big. [It's in an old apartment, downtown in a big city and yet it's still far larger than an average bedroom at 12.5*16ft.] 

3) No slippers and toothbrushes available so it might be good to bring your own. [yes. yes. might be a good idea to bring your own toothbrush. ...? He asked for a toothbrush, toothpaste, new slippers, breakfast every morning, and daily towel service. I do often have extra toothbrushes for people who have forgotten, but I didn't happen to have a fresh one available when he arrived. I did have toothpaste for him though.] 

4) The wash machine and dryer are free to use so you can clean your clothes and bath towel regularly. [yes. in 4 days he did two loads of laundry. for one person. on a business trip.]

adaf7fe8-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,The End of My AirBnB Experiment,"I've had a really good run. I made some extra cash, I made some improvements to my house. I even managed to hang onto quite a bit after Uncle Sam took a bite. But the insurance factor is, at this point, an insurmountable obstacle to my continuing. 

Slice isn't available in my state. My mortgage company won't accept Proper Insurance to satisfy their HO requirement. My HO carrier offers a policy for home sharing that isn't available in my state at this time. Fortunately, they have a generally OK view toward home sharing, but I feel like I've pushed the boundaries there a little further than I'm comfortable. 

A BnB policy would eat up 3/4 of my earnings for the year and simply cannot be justified renting out a small guest suite.

Maybe one day the insurance industry will adjust a bit more to this whole ""sharing economy"" but that day isn't now.

Still, if you have a friendly carrier who allows occasional use as mine does, it can be worthwhile. And we did it while living in the house. In a house with kids. Just proof that it can be done.

I used my money to upgrade the DIY electrical the prior owner had done in guest suite, replace some windows, buy a chest freezer, replace the gutters and help build up a respectable set of tools for my DIY and woodworking hobbies. It was good.

PLEASE Please make some noise!!

What a total nightmare. Never again will accept someone that barters for price. This is the last time. The person reserved this weekend a month ago asking for a reduced price. Against my better judgement I accepted.

Turns out he arrived with 12 guests instead of the advertised 10. He asked for an extra bed which i had in the storage area. I begrudgingly kept my cool. I overhear the guests talking about going to a friends house in a town about 3 hours over and though that was strange since they were only staying the weekend.

Then an hour later i get this message.

""Hi just got to the place... wasnt to happy with no a/c. I'm happy to pay with one night but would like a refund for the other two nights. Hope you understand this is not what i expected""

Now by this point i am a little pissed off. I smell bad faith and boy was i right about that.

I call Airbnb and get assigned a case manager. Lyra concedes that I am in the right. The guest didn't search or book a home with AC. I am relieved.

Then i get a second support case this time from Casidy. She tells me the guest is now mad about the number of beds and wants to cancel. I tell her the number if beds is accurate. An hour goes by. Now its that the photos aren't representative of the listing.

Now a little background, i just put up new photos which i paid Airbnb Professional Photography for.

The case manager then proceeds to tell me that the guest has sent pictures of wear and tear and that the listing is misleading. I see the pictures shared and low and behold the guest broke the lock to one of my storage rooms!!! Took pictures of the extra beds on their sides and cleaning supplies and told her that this is what he is dealing with.

I am fuming.

I respond accordingly. The guest broke the lock to the storage area which is off limits!! The case manager counters that because the house is listed as entire house that i am not allowed to have rooms that the guest cannot enter. That together with the misleading pictures (that i paid airbnb for!!!) Meant that the listing was misleading.

I cannot believe that this is happening. Am i crazy? Am i seriously losing it? What am i missing?!

adaf8416-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,What We Learned in Our First 60 Days,"1. Nobody will read your house rules. Everyone thinks they know how to exist at a home, so to them reading your special little rules is a waste of time.

2. 90% of your guests are actually really amazing and totally cool. 10% have no idea what it means to respect other people's property, or they just think they're getting a hotel.

3. Never, ever make an exception to your house rules or just general booking parameters. Have a rule that says no parties? If someone even asks to throw a party immediately reject their booking.

4. If someone breaks one rule, they'll break all of them.

5. At all times keep a profit & loss sheet of your expenses and compare it to what a reputable property management company tells you you could get for a long term renter. 

6. Bribe your neighbors. Remember there is no scenario where having an airbnb next door is better for them than you living there.

7. A cheap Trader Joe's bottle of wine goes a LONG way.

8. Keep a point and shoot camera at the house at all times. If anything is fishy when you or your cleaning company come to turn over the house TAKE PICTURES OF EVERYTHING. 

9. If you don't do the above, never ever expect Airbnb to compensate you for anything.

10. Call your insurance company and be 100% honest with them about how you're using the property, and make sure that your insurance will cover you in case some rando burns your house down.

11. Have a deposit equal to $100 x the number of bedrooms. On Airbnb a deposit is virtually meaningless for getting money from someone that broke something if you don't do #8, but it's a douchebag deterrent.

12. Call your realtor friend and splurge the few hundred bucks for pro real estate photos, unless you can manage it yourself.

13. Create a beyondpricing.com account and at least look at their pricing recommendations, even if you don't pay for the service.

14. Call a tax person right away, because you're going to save a shit load of money on taxes if you do this correctly.

15. Never write a bad review the same day you saw wine, piss, shit, and blood all over your house. Wait a few days until you cool off!

16. White walls were a bad choice.

adaf857e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Furious with customer support so I sent this email to all the executives,"To All Airbnb Executives: 

Ive been a long time host with 9+ properties on Airbnb and average about $250k in sales/year. Recently a guest instant booked who absolutely trashed my unit. I don’t charge guest deposits because it can dissuade some people from booking. I wrongfully assumed I could count on your “Host Guarantee”.

After the guest trashed my unit, mind you in 6+ years Ive only filed one other claim (and this particular guest was brand new with no reviews) your customer service rep spoke to me with the tone that somehow I had created the damage and was accusing the guest unfairly. I understood where his skepticism was coming from and provided him with contact information for our property manager and condo security and cleaning staff to do an investigation because they were called to the unit when the guest was trashing it; but still he didn’t follow up.

So then with only one bullet left in my chamber I wrote a negative, one of the first I’ve written in 6 years, to communicate to my fellows hosts what type of guest these were. That was deleted by your staff without so much as a reasonable explanation. Which is gross negligence on Airbnb’s part. I understand you want to continue to generate revenue on booking commissions but its quite unfair for you to do so while we take all the risk and then you bar the only form of communication we have from host to host. 

Besides that, all of the bullshit I had to go through mind you this took a month and half of my time; I was finally told to purchase a TV and provide the receipt and I would be reimbursed. Well, I did that and received another email saying “after careful consideration my claim has been denied” without and clarification as to why. 

I contacted my “case manager” to discuss and she has been a ghost, not even the curtesy of a response.

Its like you guys have made it so big you don’t give a shit about us hosts anymore. Ive been discussing this on Reddit and to be truthful I’m not the only one sharing these types of experiences.

adaf86e6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,This documentary on Netflix helped me understand my Airbnb guest behaviors a little bit more,"There's an ""behavioral economics"" experiment about 1h 15 min or so into this film [DisHonesty – The Truth About Lies](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80047681) that shows how simply showing the 10 commandments to (both religious and non-religious) people immediately before their honesty matrix test completely stopped all cheating. In these tests, when people are reminded about rules & codes of conduct right before cheating opportunities, it makes a huge difference across all nationalities. I believe this explains why my issues with noise that were SO problematic stopped completely after I changed the way I communicated.

When I first started my Airbnb I didn't have a written set of rules other than the ones in the listing description - I thought my perception of ""good behavior"" was just common sense. But, of course, people are all different and there are a lots of complex reasons they make decisions that are dishonest or unethical (according to this film we all have this ""fudge factor"", and we all think we are super honest).

I found that just having a set of rules in the description of a property doesn't influence behavior. My guess, based on this film, is that it's too removed from the actual behaviors of the guests. If you want to 1) discourage guests who are ""bad fits"" and 2) guide the behavior of guests you accept, then a concise set of rules needs to be in at least the following locations:

* 1) Description body
* 2) Pre-booking message (Instant Book)
* 3) Welcome email
* 4) Printed in the home
* 5) Mentioned by the host upon check in

My 20+ years on software & web usability showed me long ago that ""people don't read."" TIL it's a little more complicated than that.

TL;DR - People need to be reminded of your rules explicitly and in the context where the behaviors might occur. Have your rules exposed in multiple contexts. People are basically good even though when they wipe make-up off on your white towels it might not seem like it  :-)

The house isn't what was advertised. I took a video that clearly shows the difference. You even get to see two bugs, a lizard on the stove, and I barely missed a cockroach scurry on the floor. There's no way I'm falling asleep. I think the property manager/co host is not mentally well. Not like violent, but she told me something about her fiance dying, suffering seizures, and she'd constantly lose track of the conversation when I was speaking to her.

I dont want to make a scene. I'm waiting for everything to get quiet, go to my car to leave, and sleep in my car at my job's parking lot. I'm thinking about calling the host and discussing it internally but clearly I'm not about confrontation, so I kind of just want to call airbnb.

Advice?

**Edit** I put a lot of pointless shit in there.

Should I call the host or can I just call airbnb? I also want what's probably least impactful on the co-host cause she seems genuine. I'm not just going to say nothing to anyone for her sake, cause come on, I need a place to sleep

**Edit2** I manage to fall asleep. I've been awoken at 3:00am by the co‐host's dog whining outside. I find dog on a leash w/ the handle on the porch fence, by this time the dog is at full yelps and barks. The airbnb is composed of two houses so I figured co-host was with the neighboring airbnb and decide to stand with the dog to calm her down.

 Whelp, i end up looking around and find co-host sprawled on her bed, no covers, same clothes on as when I met her, and snoring. I wake her up to ask if she's ok and she says, 'who are you?' She reeks of booze, I'm pretty sure she's epileptic, so not supposed to be drinking. She rambles to me about complete random shit for 30 minutes until I just had to cut the conversation to go to bed. 

This has been a shit show. I'm pretty sure I have fleas too cause I have random tingles and itches all over my body but haven't thoroughly inspected.

Me and my group of Magic: The Gathering friends from all over my country meet once every 6 months in a big Airbnb somewhere nice for a weekend. We arr 10 20-something guys that drink alcohol, smoke pot and play our game. The nightmare of any host, amiright? 

So we just came back from our stay. The host was AMAZING, she knew our plans and brought us at the check-in a homebaked cake and 2 bottles of a local liquor that were delicious. She collected our IDs etc and went on her merry way. No questions, just smiles. 

We had our weekend, big party, loud music, a lot of weed, beer and stuff... She came the last morning while we were cleaning (we made it quite dirty tbh) and saw the mess. She just told us ""I came to tell you guys not to clean but since you are at it"" And started helping us. All smiles and laugh. 

She was amazing, no doubt. She took two polaroids of us, one for the group and the other for a poster she had at the house with all her ""great guests"". 

We left her, sadly, not before buying her a big cheese and a bottle of good nice wine from the local artisan market. Best host ever.

adaf8b1e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,General questions from an Airbnb guest,"1. Sometimes if I don't particulary enjoy my experience, I opt to not review the person instead of giving a misleadingly false review or giving a truthfully harsh review which I understand can be subjective (especially when I see the majority of the host's reviews is positive/the host is a super host). My reasoning is ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all."" Is that ok?


2. What are you as hosts looking for when placing cameras? I am very self concious but I have nothing too serious to hide. I just feel myself being self concious of what I wear within the camera's view and being sure I am extra careful with how I handle things in the house. 


3. Is it considered rude/troublesome when a guest brings some issues to the host's attention? For example, when an appliance is not working, a drain is clogged, a desire for clean sheets, etc. I understand this is not a hotel and I don't want to come off as demanding but I also am unsure of what I can readily ask of the hosts without seeming overburdensome.

4. Does it seem rude for me to enjoy the complimentary things provided by hosts? I love coffee, tea, snacks, and freebies (who doesn't) but I feel somewhat judged by my hosts when I find myelf gravitating towards it quite often. Do you hosts judge a guest on their behavior towards their freebies?


5. What other things can I do to ensure I am being a really good guest?

The listing states check in time as 3-10pm, but the host messaged me a few days ago asking me to come at 3:30pm. I thought it was not a big deal.

As I was about to exit the train, the host messaged me telling me I wouldn’t be able to check in because the previous guest took the keys and she couldn’t get in touch with her. The host is out of town and wouldn’t be able to help. 

I assume she asked someone to clean the apartment after the previous guest left, but the person probably couldn’t clean the apartment because there was no key available.

What I don’t understand is that the host told me that originally the previous guest was supposed to come pick up her luggage at 7pm. How would that be possible if I was supposed to check in at 3:30pm and the reservation is for the entire apartment?

The host told me to leave my luggage at the central station and walk around. It’s past 4pm here and the luggage drop off place closes at 7:45pm.

I contacted Airbnb, but they have only suggested one listing that looks crappy. Is there any way I can push Airbnb or the host to pay for a hotel nearby or a decent Airbnb? I feel like all the decent listings have been booked already.

I’m sitting at a cafe inside the station feeling exhausted and frustrated.


Edit: The host contacted me saying she managed to get the apartment ready right after Airbnb found a decent place for me. She was upset that she would be penalized and I contacted the customer service. I had to cancel this 3 night reservation on my end and she only had to refund me $30! Since I didn’t stay, I won’t be able to leave a negative review and she got most of her money. Why would she complain? I asked Airbnb which place I should head to, and their answer was “either”. Since I was already on my way to the new place, I decided not to stay at the apartment I booked originally. This apartment doesn’t have a washer or a terrace like the one I booked originally, but I’m not gonna complain about not having those amenities. This was a crappy experience. I lost 3 hours in Rome.

Update (July 15th): An Italian agent called me and it costed me $20 to talk to her. She blamed me for not waiting for the host to get the apartment ready and basically told me it was not the host’s fault and she shouldn’t be blamed. She said I didn’t deserve any refund.

-Left trash out on counters

-Did not deflate the air mattresses we let them use

-Left dirty dishes in the sink

-Kicked the bottom of our bathroom door hard enough to knock off a piece of the wood

-Used every towel we had and left them in a big wet pile

-Did not strip the linens from the bed or pillows

-Didn’t empty the lint tray in our dryer after use

-Left coffee rings all over the counters

-Repeatedly left the door unlocked throughout their stay

-Left all the lights on when they left

adaf9226-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,PSA: Having a Superhost badge does not affect your search ranking,"In the past week this topic keeps coming up and I find myself having arguments with people who have convinced themselves that it is true. I dont like seeing misinformation spread about this because people get super stressed out about losing their Superhost badge when they really shouldn't.

Here is the policy straight from Airbnb: 

>While the Superhost designation doesn’t boost a listing, the factors that earn you Superhost status do.

https://www.airbnb.co.nz/help/article/39/what-factors-determine-how-my-listing-appears-in-search-results

So the reason you see a lot of superhosts at the top of search results is because the criteria for superhost are also criteria for high search ranking! Things like response time, no cancellations, star rating. Therefore, if you cancel a reservation you will lose superhost and ALSO take a hit in search rankings. You didnt fall down the search results because you lost superhost. You fell down because you cancelled. You have lost superhost for a year, but your **search ranking can recover sooner**.

**I have never been a superhost due to cancelling a reservation 6 months ago. I still rank very highly on search results. When filtering by price, I am in the top three despite not being the cheapest**.

Some people, presumably flat earth believers, think Airbnb are lying about the algorithm on their website and Superhosts will indeed show above non-superhosts on search results. Well luckily it is easy to prove this is false, simply look at my screenshot below. 

Its a search of my city with no filters applied. The THIRD RESULT is not a superhost. Followed by superhosts, and more non-superhosts. There are plenty of superhosts at the very bottom. 

You can prove this for yourself, I have no idea why this post was necessary.

We just had a guest leave who booked for 5 nights describing the visit as '5 friends and colleagues attending a conference'. Great! Our house sleeps 8 comfortably and our town hosts tons of conferences, also the lady who booked is herself a super-host. I wrote back to ask how many beds they'd need prepared as 2 of the 5 are pull out's and require extra work. They never responded.

48 hours before the booking I sent our standard welcome message (because no one ever checks the check in instructions) and asked again how many beds they needed - no response.

As it turns out the guest whose account was used to book was not in the group staying at my place, it was her husband who booked that showed up (we think). We have live in an in-law suite on the property and have Nest cameras and noticed that each night of the booking different combinations of people were spending the night.

The 2nd night we saw between 10 and 12 people coming in to the place with booze. We were a bit alarmed but they all seemed like descent folks and they were totally quiet by 10:30, so we let it go. But we did send a message asking the guest to clarify what was going on - no response

Finally at 11pm I went over and asked them to keep it down in person, I also said we don't allow parties, to which the dude who opened the door replied ""Oh, we're not having a party, there's only 12 of us"" as I stared directly at a what can only be described as a small party, beer, pizza, chips. Anyway, they kept it down and left the house the next day without incident.

I really want to leave an honest review for this dude, it pisses me off when people don't treat my house or us as hosts with basic courtesy. He didn't, wouldn't or couldn't communicate, he tromped on basic house rules and was using someone else's account. That said, they also left the place in good condition and were, except for the parties, generally quiet.

adaf9adc-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Hosts, what would you want in a review for this guest?","I had a guest book our private room for two weeks starting last week. They also have a private room listed on Airbnb, so I assumed that they knew how the website worked.

They arrived and stated that they were happy with the place but soon became confused as to why I was not leaving and asked me where I would be sleeping. I told them that I would be sleeping in the other bedroom.

They then started arguing with each other. Or rather, the husband started emotionally abusing abusing his wife by calling her stupid and telling her that the whole thing was her fault as she was the one who had booked the room. I went to my room and left them arguing. After closing my door, I heard what sounded like a slap. I assume the husband hit his wife but, as I did not see this, I cannot say for sure.

A few minutes later I received a message from the husband letting me know that he wanted to talk to me.

He told me that they had booked a private room and not a shared space, so I couldn't stay there. I told him that a private room is a private ROOM and not a private home and that I was providing them with this as we would not be sharing a bedroom. He continued to be adamant that I was wrong and he was right about what a private room was until I showed him the definition on Airbnb, at which point he started insulting his wife again.

He then asked me if I could stay somewhere else for two weeks and give him and his wife the entire home for no extra cost.

I told him that this would not be possible as I would end up paying the same or more to stay somewhere else and it would cost me money for them to stay in our home. I told him that they could upgrade to an entire home if he wanted, but it would cost five times the price and I could not make it any cheaper as it would not be worthwhile for my partner and I to deal with both the financial costs and inconvenience of booking a place somewhere else for two weeks.

He then asked for a refund in cash on the spot. I told him that he would have to go through Airbnb if they wanted a refund and that, as this was their first time booking, Airbnb might give them travel credits towards booking an entire home.

I have a strict cancellation policy and these guests  had already taken up several hours of my time before arrival by asking somewhere between 30-35 questions, several of which I had already answered more than once.

Anyway, the guest refused to contact Airbnb and turned nasty towards me at this point. He started pretending that the place was filthy and started insulting my home, which they had previously stated that they were happy with upon check in.

In particular he flipped out over there being dishes drying next to the sink. He felt that these should not have been there upon check in. The guests had asked for an early check in due to having several heavy bags after arriving from the airport. I told them that the place might not be completely ready before they arrive as I had guests checking out around the same time as they wanted to check in. Despite this, I managed to get the entire place clean before their arrival. The only issue being the dishes still drying.

The husband made it clear that if I did not refund them in full, they would be leaving me a bad review and would make several false claims.

Talking to him became pointless, so I left to call Airbnb in order to explain the situation to them.

Airbnb spoke to the guests and they told Airbnb that they wanted me to book somewhere else for myself for the next two weeks while they stayed here alone. Airbnb then called me asking if I could do this. I told Airbnb that this would not be possible as it would cost me money to stay elsewhere and that the only way that this would happen is if they paid five times the nightly rate.

Airbnb then passed this information on to the guests and the guests agreed to stick to their original booking.

The husband then appeared to be rather OCD when it came to cleanliness as apparently he cannot sleep in bedding that anybody else has ever slept in, no matter how thoroughly it has been cleaned. He had packed his own bedding to use here. This is a first for me.

He then spent over an hour cleaning an already clean bathroom as he was convinced that fading colour on some of our floor tiles in the shower was dirt. Obviously he was not able to restore the original colour through cleaning and the bathroom looked exactly the same as it did before he started cleaning it. The only difference being that he had cracked one of the tiles and had flooded the bathroom floor.

The next day I received several messages from the guest pestering me for a refund. I continued to tell them that we have a strict cancellation policy and if they felt that they were entitled to a refund they would have to contact Airbnb. This did not stop the guest from asking the same question over and over again.

Later that day they told me that they had just found out that their visas were going to expire some time next week (supposedly today), so they would need to shorten their stay.

They actually don't need a visa to be here at all unless they plan on staying beyond 30 days and I know this for a fact. Given that their flight landed the day they checked in and they flew here from another country, they could stay in the country for over two weeks more if they wanted to (it's also really easy to extend the visa...).

The guest sent me an alteration request, which I declined as the guest would have been refunded and I would have owed Airbnb money had I accepted it. The guest immediately sent the same alteration request straight back and made it clear that she would keep sending the alteration request back every time I declined it.

I contacted Airbnb. Airbnb contacted the guest. Suddenly their visas were fine (no surprise there) and, as they wouldn't get a refund they decided to stay until the end of their booking.

We haven't seen the guests at all beyond the second night as they are out all day and are only here to sleep.

For the most part, they have been cleaning up after themselves. However, yesterday I was shocked to discover a large pile of food on the floor downstairs (which had attracted cockroaches and other insects) which they had clearly dropped on the floor and left instead of cleaning it up.

We also have a rule that guests need to use the shower curtain when they have a shower and we even have a sign in the bathroom reminding guests of this (before this we used to have several guests ignoring the shower curtain assuming that the entire room was a wet room). These are the only guests we have had since the sign was put up that have ignored this rule. Every time they shower the far walls, the bathroom door, the toilet and sometimes even the toilet paper are completely soaked in water. They are mopping the floor at least though...

I am fully expecting a bad review from these guests for refusing to refund them or give them the entire home and they are most definitely getting a bad review from me as well.

* Makes an enquiry for Tuesday and Thursday night. Asking for a discount (no reason given).
* We politely let them know we only give discounts for substantial bookings (week or more) or for some returning guests.
* Requests a discount again (still no reason)
* Give them the same response again, also pointing out we have one of the cheapest rates in the city.
* They insta-book with us anyhow.
* They show up and we do the show-and-tell around the house. We only offer a single room, but we make sure they know where all the facilities are etc. Pointed out our egg basket to them. We have six chickens in the garden that keep us pretty well supplied. We let our guests help themselves to them on a morning if they wish (We have a sign on the front of the house selling these eggs too).
* Guest seems nice enough and we always welcome people to join us if they wish to socialise. We were cooking a big meal so offered them the option to join us if they wished.
* Guest leaves review after first night. Apparently our list of amenities is innaccurate. We questioned what they meant by this and they said there was 'no clear breakfast routine'. In short they expected a served breakfast. They were forced to cook their own breakfast using the free eggs we provide.
* Fast-forward to today, their second stay (Thursday): Guest messages us asking what's for dinner.

We don't provide meals. I think that's pretty much standard offering amongst AirBnB hosts. The guest has used AirBnB at least twice before so this shouldn't be something new to them either. They're also the first person to expect as much with us.

We try to be sociable where possible, and have met some fantastic people hosting that have quickly become repeat guests with us. Others choose to remain in the room which is totally fine too. The important thing for us is we try and do our best for anyone staying here, in much the same manner as we would a friend. It's few and far between but we do get guests that treat us as a hotel in complete indifference to what AirBnB actually is.

In the past we've also had:

* Poor review stating there were too many cushions on the bed. Precisely the same number in fact as there were in the pictures on our AirBnB page. Also didn't feel like sharing this with us after a three night stay (pretty sure we could have come up with a solution for this complex problem)

* Couple showing up over three hours late and saying 'Oh, we have a baby. Is that OK?'. We don't allow young children simply because we can't insure their safety in the house and haven't provided any amenities for them. Unless you gave birth on the way here (might explain the delay) there's no reason to not mention this when booking or prior to arrival. What are we going to say- ""No, leave it in the car""?

* Poor review complaining that it was awkward that we (the hosts) were also in the house. Not sure where to start with that one.

I paid a premium for it (1 bedroom listings in the same neighborhood were priced around $90-$140, I paid $184/night plus fees, so about $200/night on average). Now, to be fair, this place that I am in is probably above average (high floor, super location, nice furnishings) but it does. not. have a pool or gym, which I would really like to have (do not feel safe running outside and it is really hot and I would like to swim as well). 

Now, the owner said access to the pool and gym was via ""membership"" which she would arrange. It has been three days since I checked in (arrived Monday, today is Wednesday, I leave Saturday). She refunded me $25 (ha!) for my inconvenience but I don't feel this is sufficient, what do you think I should do now? 

I could either try to cancel this listing and move to the hotel next door (which has the pool and gym, but not kitchen). Or ask for a bigger refund ($40/night - would that be fair?). What's your advice here? 

PS there are also other problems with this listing. She gave me an inaccurate address (to circumvent condo rules banning Airbnb I think) and the place was not well cleaned (sticky tpatches of lube left, plus empty condom boxes. yuck. but otherwise clean ... i think).

As a few of you said this isn't a business for me.  We started this because I love hosting, cooking and meeting new people.  My home is a few doors down from the rental and I regularly invite my guests over for dinner or out to events in our city.  Most of my guests are here on business.  For those that wished me well since the loss of my Aunt, sincerely I thank you.  

&#x200B;

TLDR:  How and with whom can I file a formal complaint with about the treatment from one of their Case Managers?

&#x200B;

I am a Super Host and thus far I have enjoyed my experience.  Until now.  My family experienced an unexpected death of my Aunt and I had to fly down for the viewing and funeral.  My current guest is well taken care of and I informed him I was traveling.  My other available room was not booked and I turned on the 24-hour response/inquiry because I knew I'd be out of pocket here and there with all the arrangements being made.

&#x200B;

A guest with a different host was displaced and a Case Manager decided to telephone me to see if I'd accept the guest.  I was at the viewing.  I could not get to my phone and frankly, I was not concerned with anything that happened outside of the funeral home and only my family.

&#x200B;

I finally responded.  Copied directly from the message.

**P----8:58 PM**I'm out of town for a funeral. I'll get to this when I'm able.

**Airbnb Support8:59 PM**Understandable. Would you be able to accept this later by 9pm? guest is asking. Thank you for your understanding, sorry if I am sucha bother I am just trying tohelp a guest.

**P---9:05 PM**No reservation was canceled. Both the last offers we're pre-approved and both expired. I'm not sure who Devin is out of the two requests that came in. He can re-request it and once I'm out of the funeral home this evening, I'll look at it.

**Airbnb Support9:05 PM**He is a new guy.

Ok, gotcha! request is there, he can check in until when you are avaialble.

Thank, I will let him know.

&#x200B;

Now mind you when I responded at 8:58 PM I had received a total of now six phone calls from an 855 #.  After the first four, I moved my phone from vibrate to silent.

&#x200B;

Once we finished with dinner and being with family I pulled out my laptop and accepted the guest's request.   I then requested a Manager/Supervisor to contact me.  I was upset because of 1.  Once he found out I was dealing with a death he kept on messaging me and 2.  He offered zero condolences or compassion.

&#x200B;

He called me today himself and I said that I was disappointed in the lack of respect for my time and that he should have moved onto another Host once he found out I was dealing with a death.   The call did not go well.  He was combative and told me that if I was unable to run my business then I should have made other arrangements.  Instead of cursing and screaming, I told him I was ending this conversation and told him to have a good night.  Here is what happened next:

**Airbnb Support6:29 PM**

Hi Pepper. Thank you for taking my call. As discussed, we reached out to you purely because of business and we were not aware of the funeral. After informing us about it, we did mention we are aware that we were being a bother and we apologized to you right away. If you feel you needed more understanding and other words said to you as you lost a loved one, I understand, it is not easy going through a death in the family and managing responsibility to a business. I think it could have been better if the main host and you as a co host had discussed about this and the responsibilities of a host, a co host. Since you had requested this support thread to be over, we shall not be reaching out to you again. You may resign as a co host if you feel this situation should tell if you continue or not with co hosting and if the host pulls their listing out of the platform, we would still understand and will respect the main host's decision and yours too. We appreciate everything you did for hosting and know that we meant well for your business, nothing else.

To help keep our community safe and trusted, we’ve published our standards and expectations for all hosts and travelers. We developed these standards based on our extensive experience interacting with members of the Airbnb community.

You made your problem my problem. When we could not respond you should have moved onto another host. Period. Once you were notified I was at a funeral, your response should have been ""my condolences"" and moved on to another host, NOT can I get this done by 9 PM when it was 8:59 PM. Apparently, this concept is lost on you. Your remark of ""I think it could have been better if the main host and you as a co-host had discussed about this and the responsibilities of a host, a co host."" Sir, my responsibilities were met before I traveled out of state. How dare you insinuate that this debacle is our fault. Do not contact me further.

**Airbnb Support6:42 PM**

I appreciate everything you said, the feedback. Please know that we go through the same training for Airbnb around the world and we try to be gentle with our words, choose the correct approach, but are not afraid to reach out if it means business, which is what had been done, plainly business. I understand it may have seemed a young man from support called and blasted you with questions neglecting the fact that you were in a funeral but trust me that was not the case, unless 10 years younger than you is young then I would agree. I could have easily stopped messaging you at that time if you had told me you're not able to manage the co hosting at the moment, but you have sent me questions, so it seemed a response was needed and so I did. I hope you feel better sooner or later and if ever in time you realize you might have said what you said out of emotion, know that you are forgiven. We are both going through a similar phase in our lives right now, I was just at work at the time . Take care P----

&#x200B;

**P----6:49 PM**Sir, I told you at 8:58 PM I was at a funeral and would handle this when I was able. No response was warranted. It was not a question that was asked. You, sir, responded with a question. ""Would you be able to accept this later by 9 PM?"" You sent that at 8:59 PM. So you are wrong. I did not ask you a question that needed answering. Now, again, do not contact me further.

&#x200B;

Forgiven? Are you fucking serious? I will be escalating this to your superiors. I terminated the call and wished you well before my emotions took the best of me. You should not be in the position you're in and I will be escalating this to Sr. Management.

Hi p---. I was at a meeting for almost an hour. I just got back and I am sorry you feel that I should be in the position I am in, this is the escalations and I am a Case Manager that tried to help you get the booking which you had accomodated and earned a booking. Due to your request of not being contacted, I will not be contacting you any more, but please know that there are no problems on your account to resolve, this was mainly about you feeling like you were not approached the right way. Although we had explained and apologized multiple times, I under, stand, that this may still, appear different to you.

**Airbnb Support7:45 PM**

If you are not able to manage the business side of things at the moment due to the grieving, I think it could have been better if the main host was informed, so a co host that can manage it can receive the inquries. If you were not able to receive inquiries or messages, then it could have been stated clearly to stop sending messages, when you got the first inquriy from me, but more questions was sent from your end. These could have easily been messages from the guest but it came from us, as a guest asked us to do so. We meant well for your business. I am closing this ticket now.

&#x200B;

**P----7:45 PM**

The amount of ignorance coming for you is astounding. It's apparent that you feel you must get the last word in, hence the fact you ignored my cease communication. I have forwarded our transcript to your CEO  and Global Head of Community. If they feel you acted and responded within AirBnB's policies, then you're fine. If not, then I wish you the best in your next endeavor.

Second trip: Hosts were brilliant, gave local tips and even helped me out as i became sick.

It's just nice. For me at least, as most content on this sub seems to show another site of airbnb.",0.91,35,1554628936.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/baekg5/something_positive_about_the_whole_thing/,True,7
adafabc6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Locked out of our airbnb - what to expect,"So, fiance and i had a nice vacation planned - I saw an e-mail from host indicating check in was thru door code and provided within 3 days. I didn't see another e-mail and assumed it would be updated on the listing (my fault here for not checking this more carefully). Anyway, we fly in and arrive to the listing around 11pm to find out that no door code was provided on the listing. Called all the numbers on the listing and got no answer - eventually we gave up and went to eat and called airbnb who attempted to contact the hosts for 30-45min (they also offered to pay for our meal).

&#x200B;

I got a text finally from the host apologizing and giving the door code, I was relieved and thought that was that. We left the restaurant and went to haul our luggage up to the place only to find that while the code indeed worked there was still a deadbolt on the door that was apparently locked. Called / texted the host yet again, no response. Airbnb finally called back and said they were unable to contact the host, i relayed the events that just happened but the result was the same, they were going to cancel the booking.

&#x200B;

At this point it was 1 am and 20 below freezing outside, airbnb didnt have any partner hotels in the area with availability and instead suggested i do a walk in reservation. Given the location and weekend, this meant pretty much everywhere was $300+ a night. Airbnb said to send them the bill but that they would only be able to cover a portion of it and they would have to see the bill first to know how much - i argued this but it was past 1am and we just needed a place.

&#x200B;

Ended up booking a holiday inn for the night. What can I really expect here? This really threw a wrench in our vacation, skiing today was cancelled as we both feel like shit from not getting to bed until 2:30am after being out in the cold. I don't really know what I'm looking for here other than to vent and say how much this blows. Wish airbnb could penalize the hosts and use that to pay for my accommodations or something.",0.98,37,1552750420.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/b1to90/locked_out_of_our_airbnb_what_to_expect/,True,24
adafad2e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Today I messed up not saying something,"AirBnB host posted pictures of an apartment that wasn’t his. We show up only one room in the listing was actually his. We weren’t planning on using that rooms anyway because just two of us(wife and i) were staying in the master bedroom. 

We checked in late Monday night 9pm. I had to be up at 5 am for surgery Tuesday morning so we decided to just deal with it. Come to find out the next morning would get worse. 

I went to shower and the only available soap is a use pubic hair infested soap bar. Luckily my wife brought her shampoo and conditioner. So I used her shampoo to clean my body. Went to grab towel, brown streaks on it. Luckily we brought towels because it listed a hot tub. 

We had it booked to stay tonight(Wednesday night) but I can’t stay here any more it’s too gross. I reach out to host and he refuses to cancel last day. 

I reached out to customer care and we are working out a deal right now. They just offered me 50% off last day. I didn’t reach out to the host first night to resolve this stuff. Since it’s my first stay I didn’t know the rules. 

Lesson learned. Here are some pictures for your entertainment.

adafae96-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Hosts Beware: Loophole in cancellation policy,"Background: I have a moderate cancellation policy meaning that I keep a significant portion of the fees if you cancel less than a week before your trip starts. Due to a number of bad experiences, I don't allow parties, I don't allow people who live in my city (Chicago) to book, and I don't allow people with no reviews to auto-book.

Someone from Chicago with no reviews asked if he could book the place next weekend. After asking a few questions, I let him book against my better judgement but reiterated my no parties policy. A few hours later, he asked if he could move to the following weekend, saying that he'd screwed up the weekends that his girlfriend was flying in, blah blah. I didn't give it much thought and accepted the change. Immediately after doing so, that sneaky little shit canceled on me without having to pay any fees! Airbnb support was their usual level of helpful (aka completely useless) on the matter.

Overall I'm happy that I didn't have that sneaky little rat dick in my house as I'd probably have to count the silverware after he'd left; but still super annoyed with the loophole.

adafaffe-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Airbnb is falsely advertising prices, and they seem to be ok with it.","I've been browsing Airbnb, and I noticed that some homes will change their price when you enter dates, a quick google turns up [this page](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1369/why-did-the-price-of-my-reservation-change-after-i-selected-dates) which seems reasonable. The price of an apartment changes based on the time that you book it - no problem.

But then this begs the secondary question, what times can you book in order to get the price quoted on the airbnb site? I searched around for a while trying to find the answer, I played with the date picker for a while. No dice, so I sent a message to Airbnb asking about it. I linked an example property (which I shall now refer to as example property) where the listing price was £31, but any attempt to book it would raise the price to between £50-£100.

Amusingly - they responded with a phone call. I had a chat with the guy from airbnb, listened while he practically recited that page word for word. I explained to him that I understood that the price changes based on time/demand and that's perfectly reasonable, but that's not the question I'm asking, and that I'm asking under what criteria can I book example property for the advertised £31 a night, I don't mind what dates, I don't mind number of people.

He said that he understood, and just reiterated that this was up to the host based on their custom pricing, he kept on trying to direct me to contact the host for a ""special offer"", or look at other properties in the area that were cheaper. After going round in circles for a while, he finally agreed he'd go and talk to his colleagues about the issue and call me back in 15 minutes

During the first call I set up some call recording, so I caught the end of the first call and the whole of the 2nd one. I had a feeling this was going to get amusing, and sure enough it did. He spent ages trying to explain to me that it was the hosts ""custom pricing"", get me to book other properties, asking me to contact the host for a special offer, etc etc. With me continually saying ""No, I want to book example property for £31 a night as its advertised, I don't care when, I don't care what number of guests, I want to know the criteria that I can book this for £31 a night""

He finally caved, and confirmed to me that there was absolutely no way for me to book the property at £31 a night, no combination of dates, number of guests, or any other setting would allow me to book the property at the advertised price.

Surprising to have them just blatantly admit to false advertising, but there you go.

Edit: To be clear since a bunch of people are commenting about this. Airbnb confirmed to me on the phone that there is no combination of dates, guests, or any other criteria that would allow me to book the example apartment for the price listed. I am fully aware that hotels, and airbnbs change the prices on different dates and I have no problem with this practice. I have a problem with there literally being no way to book the apartment for the price that is advertised.",0.74,41,1548690813.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/akoptt/airbnb_is_falsely_advertising_prices_and_they/,True,148
adafb166-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Why I'll never get rid of our disclosed security cameras from our home.,"I am a 5-star Airbnb Superhost who has been hosting our home to guests in our guest bedrooms for nearly a year. All private rooms are on the second floor and we have several cameras in our home that are near entrances and exits only on the first floor. We use these cameras for general home security such as break-ins but also use them as a way to be notified when guests arrive/leave the home as we have a smart door that allows for self check-in. We've never had a major issue with a guest in the home, but have had one or two incidents (food going missing, guests bringing undisclosed strangers into the home, etc) where we have felt justified in keeping the cameras for our personal safety and security. They are completely disclosed in the listing, stating we have cameras in first floor common areas of the home and at entrances/exits/outdoors. You must acknowledge our cameras presence in the listing before booking.

With some of the recent articles of people complaining about cameras in their airbnb common spaces I was concerned, we obviously don't want to make guests uncomfortable, but we also want to balance with our own safety/security. So after reading the article I had a conversation with my partner about our cameras and we discussed whether we thought we should continue to use them or not, whether we thought they were in obvious enough places and pointed in relevant directions for our safety and security. The article in question I know was about someone with UNDISCLOSED cameras that were essentially hidden in corners and while in the listing's photos were hard to see. I obviously don't agree with this... but the article got me thinking about the possibility of if we needed them and to consider moving to only outdoor cameras or getting rid of them completely for guest comfort.... but boy am I glad I hadn't decided to remove them yet.

Our guest last night, just days after my partner and I had this discussion about moving and removing our cameras, was easily the worst experience we've had hosting yet. The guest has over 30 5-star reviews... which is about the strangest piece of the story. The guest checked in with their fiance at 6:30pm and everything seemed fine... by 8:00pm we had to kick them out. After locking themselves in their bedroom and pulling a piece of furniture in front of the door to barricade themselves in... i believe they used an illegal substance in the room, because when he emerged, he was no longer sober.

I was not in the home at the time, but my partner and our roommates were in their private spaces, and the guest went downstairs to the common space and ON CAMERA after looking directly at the camera, dug through two of my bags, stealing 2 nice pairs of winter gloves, and then walked to our personal liquor cabinet and proceeded to drink Patron directly from the bottle with his mouth and then poured himself at least 3 additional drinks in a 15 minute span and smoked a cigarette in the house. My partner came downstairs to the kitchen and saw him sitting with a glass of grand mariner and smelled the smoke and asked him if I (the listing host) had offered the drink to him, and the guest then became agitated and said ""Do you have a problem with me?"" and became very aggressive in his tone and body language. He also made a racist comment to my partner about ""black people destroying the homes in the area"" where we lived, to which my partner disagreed with him and changed the subject.... another strange piece of this story is while the guest was a white male, his ""fiance"" with him was a black female... they also seemed to have no bags with them when they checked in.

Thankfully, my partner de-escalated the situation and called me, which then caused me to contact Airbnb for guidance, and then after ANOTHER altercation where he became agitated with my partner when he brought up his smoking (which is against our rules) my partner finally asked to leave. The guest refused to leave unless my partner promised he'd be refunded . After watching the moments that were caught on camera, as a small female myself, I am so thankful it was my male partner there with him and not myself as I would have felt very much in danger.

We asked Airbnb if he could be suspended so that he could not make another reservation on Airbnb until they reviewed the videos we have... I was very concerned after he left the home that he could end up at ANOTHER host's home unsuspecting of his behavior... I was assured they'd speak to someone in security after my call with them, but I'm certainly not convinced that they did anything to prevent him from staying with another host that night.

If it were not for my cameras in common spaces, his aggression to my partner, racist comment, theft of about $100 worth of my personal items, and consumption of our alcohol would have had no proof and from my dispute experience so far with Airbnb.... they will do next to nothing without proof of this kind. Needless to say our cameras aren't going anywhere anytime soon while we live in this home with our close friends.

I know some guests say they'd never stay in a home with cameras, and while I understand I also would like to point out that as the good guest I assume you are, not all guests behave in a safe and respectful manner. I am most upset that this person had over 30+ 5 star reviews and I had no way of being warned or knowing this would happen... no sign or red flag. I urge hosts to please DISCLOSE any issues you have with guests, even if small I think it is your responsibility as a host to warn others. If I had said goodbye to this guest and found out that another person he stayed with later that night had been hurt or property damaged by him, I'd feel very guilty for not saying something... I hope hosts will take sketchy behavior like this seriously and if you see something, say something.

I am just starting through the process of sending my documentation to Airbnb for his behavior and theft and if there are any updates to my story I will add them here. My goal is to have him banned from the platform.

UPDATE: (1-25-19) I do have confirmation now that his account has been suspended from Airbnb, so that's a relief. I am going to our local precinct today to file a police report so that I can complete Airbnb's incident report forms and hopefully get some money from our stolen property and alcohol back.",0.81,40,1548259394.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/aj15jt/why_ill_never_get_rid_of_our_disclosed_security/,True,31

I've gotten great reviews overall and honestly only 1 of the reviewers have given me actual feedback on why they didn't give all 5 stars. 

The area that irks me the most is 'value'. I offer up an entire flat with a bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom, a deck that overlooks the city, grill, 52 inch TV, etc. All of this for $75 in an area where you won't get anything close to that for no less than $150. Of course value is in the eye of the beholder but it's just frustrating things like this or 'accuracy' can keep me from being a superhost.

adafb9d6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Friends and I stayed at an Airbnb and all of our items were stolen!!! NEED HELP!,"So 4 friends and I stayed at an Airbnb this past weekend in Las Vegas for EDC. The Electric Daisy Carnival is a 3 day musical event that is from 5pm - 5am everyday day for those 3 days. So this Airbnb was an apartment on the first floor. 

We got there and unpacked and got ready to leave. We left around 5pm and stayed out until we got home around 6am the next day. We got home and everything was fine. We went to sleep and got up the second day and got ready once again. We left again around 6pm the second day and got home at 6am the next day and when we got to the Airbnb we noticed the back window of the apartment was broken and fully opened.

We look in the rooms and everywhere and see that everything is missing, EVERYTHING! From our luggage to all of our clothes, even dirty clothes, all of our toiletries, jewelry and electronics. All we had left is what we had on us when we took off for day 2 of the event. 

What was weird and suspicious to me is that none of the items of the host were taken? I called and texted our host right away and she didn’t bother replying or calling back until like an hour later, even though she was reading my messages. So I don’t want to blame her but it seems weird. Someone could’ve also just been watching us and seen how long we were gone at night and done it then but I don’t know.

So I called the police and they came and they actually told me that Airbnb’s are actually ILLEGAL in Las Vegas so our host and her insurance would actually be liable for our stolen items. So they made a police report and documented and valued all of our stolen items. 

So I contacted Airbnb and they said they don’t have any insurance that covers guests stolen items. They at least refunded our money for the stay and we had to find another place to stay in meantime because it wasn’t safe there.

My questions basically are. What do I do know? I have a copy of the police report that shows the value of our items already, which added to over $4,000. Our host finally contacted saying that she’ll do her best to resolve this, but I don’t know because she doesn’t to fully try and contact me and update me. But since it’s illegal to host an Airbnb for her, I was thinking small claims court? Since she’s liable.

They told us it's nothing to do with us. They are paying for a hotel for 3 nights which is helpful but this whole thing has been a fiasco. My wife is a travel nurse and works night shift and we travel with two dogs.

Has anyone had this happen? Does anyone know why this might have happened?

Edit: AirBnb refunded us the remaining money for the rest of the month that we paid earlier and sent us some listings similar to what we needed. Unfortunately, only one of those is in the same price range while the others are 600+ a month more. But that's just what's available so I guess we have to settle for anything. 

The host was a rental company who provides corporate housing so I'm not sure how that could be different. They haven't contacted us. Airbnb has been great though. I just hope we find somewhere that won't put us in a bind financially. 

Thank you guys for all of the replies!

Edit 2: Because we only had options that were more than our budget allowed, we asked AirBnB if they could discount the price or something similar and they were totally cool about it and are giving us a voucher that will basically cover a big portion of the difference.

(Honestly- I would ask you guys, the main public, whether these types of reviews are common- I haven’t seen them in the half-dozen other times I’ve been on AirBnB). 

He’s based around the California coastal area and offers aquarium tickets. 

To be fair, 99% of the feedback is positive. A couple of them really stood out though. 
The negative host-responses seemed like a mix of sarcasm, over-defensiveness, and advertising:  

Here are just some examples: 


________________

JESSIE: Decent place. Not exactly an ocean view from the house though. It's in a quiet neighborhood, but only about a 10 minute drive to the main parts of Monterey. Nothing too special, but the aquarium tickets definitely make this place worth the price if you are planning on going to the aquarium.

 (HOST): Thank you soooo much. It is so special that you offer you home to us. We are soooo appreciative for allowing us into your home that you obviously worked hard to obtain and even harder to maintain. We loved our room with vaulted ceilings and nice art work on the walls. We can really see you put a lot of effort into presenting this special home to us. I can only hope that when I grow up I'll have a house half as nice as this one. But that's just a dream! I never achieve anything on my own. But I will inherit all my parents worked for. I hope they die soon. I'm quite sure I could spend all of my inheritance in a flash and live in my car with a smelly pit bull. Let's not forget about my drug addiction cause everyone knows ungrateful people find that nothing satisfies like opiates. I'm very sure that when I overdose in the park my last thought will be of appreciation of my lovely stay. I'm quite certain my pit bull will eat my dead body. Waste not want not. Thanks again for the wonderful stay.

It wasn't a big issue to get in to the aquarium but would have been nice to be informed that there were some precautions to take if they were being used.

 (HOST): Unhappy people leave unhappy reviews. The home is professionally cleaned everyday. This guest said nothing but nice things wile she was hear. I guess someone made her angry. Sorry. I do recall this guest being dirty. So yes my house was dirty. It was dirtied by this guest. But future guests can be sure that her mess was cleaned up immediately.

ISABELLE : I wouldn't recommend staying here. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I had quite a few issues staying with (host). Upon making my booking with (host) and sending him the payment (including the extra tax payment which most air bnb hosts don't ask for) he then informed me on the day of our arrival there was no wifi at house. As we were traveling over from England this was quite a big issue for us because our phones did not work without wifi, however this allowed us no time to change our mind and find another place to stay. Without wifi we had checked the property listing and seen the property had a TV so thought at least we could keep ourselves occupied with that on an evening. On arrival to the house.. no TV. We then went to have a shower after a long day of travelling, when it was made clear to us that no one had stayed in the house for a long time previous as both showers (ensuite and main bathroom) were too stiff to even turn on! So much so we called (host) as we thought they were broken! When we met (host) we automatically felt unwelcome by him as he expressed his frustration at being called round about the showers and told us to get an American phone if we needed to use the internet.. which is completely ridiculous as we had paid for a property with wifi in the first place! Throughout the stay I was sent constant, unnecessary messages by (host) which made it difficult to enjoy my stay. At one point he even messaged to tell me that all food should be kept in the fridge (EVERYTHING, crisps, cereals, everything!) and then later on told other guests to help themselves to any food in the fridge! Our food!! We also found out he had messaged other guests about the troubles with the showers stating 'the Europeans' can't work them. Overall (host) was the rudest and strictest air bnb host I have ever stayed with and I would sincerely recommend you to not stay here for a long period of time (we stayed 4 nights).

 (HOST): I'm glad you enjoyed your stay except for the first 6 hours. Yes the Internet was down when they arrived. The very next morning the Internet was back. Sorry out of my controll. 6 hours of no internet and no tv. The shower worked fine. I jumped out of bed at midnight to show them how to turn on a shower. Standard shower valve. I'm glad you enjoyed staying at a newly remodeled home in a king sized bed. I'm glad you enjoyed the evening sunsets from the living room couch. I'm glad you enjoyed the free aquarium tickets ($100 value). I'm glad you enjoyed the view of the Monterey bay from the living room, dining room, and kitchen. I'm glad you enjoyed the large 4K tv with toooo many choices. I'm glad you appreciated the free parking in the driveway.

RAUL: I don't recommend this place to anybody. (host) is almost impossible to reach him was unfriendly and arrogant. I never will be back to his place.


HOST: Raul I read over all our communication and everything we communicated is very positive and we actually praises each other. ""Thank you for being a great guest"" and you responded ""thanks for the great room and aquarium tickets"". We never met but you clearly communicated satisfaction and value. I hope guests will read the other reviews to get a clear picture that what I offer is a fantastic room with free aquarium tickets ($100 value for free). Raul paid $65 for 1 night stay. If Raul,was to pay retail for the aquarium then it's as if I paid him to stay with me!? Please read the reviews above and below and you will get the idea. Raul got me confused with another host.

JACK: We stayed in the master bedroom at (host)'s property. It was fine. The bathroom was a but dirty which is what gives it the low marks. We had a car, so the location was fine. We did not use the rest of the house, although it was available, so perhaps for a longer stay we would have found it a better value.


HOST:  Weird that wile you stayed at my house you communicated ""the house is great and we really love this sleigh style,King bed"" that's a direct quote from our conversation. Guest should know that anytime any issues arises I'm at the house to do,what ever it takes to give all guests a wonderful stay. This guest only gave praises wile he was here. I can say that this guest left his room a mess. Future guests should know that 99% of my guest love my house and then along comes the 1% that nothing satisfies. Future gusts should just read above and below this review to get a sense of reality.

LIA: A comfortable stay in a well designed and equipped house. Stayed here because of the aquarium passes which proved excellent value for money. Location was good driving distance from Monterey, was nice and quiet and room was clean. However, we didn't feel like the host was very friendly or overly welcoming. The email explaining everything about the property didn't arrive until a few hours after we checked in. We had many rules to follow, so it didn't feel much like the 'home' we were told we were staying in. The rules kept saying it was a home not a hotel, yet we didn't meet the host and there was absolutely nothing about it that was homely. Also (host) should up the price and include the 12% tax in a single payment as this was an extra hassle. We stayed just down the road (less than 5 mins walk) in an airbnb the previous night and didn't have to pay the 12% on top. A comfortable stay but not overly impressed. Would recommend to anyone wanting to visit the aquarium.


HOST: It was a pleasure having you stay at my home. I'm glad you enjoyed you King sized bed. I'm glad you appreciated the open floor plan with hardwood floors and vaulted ceilings. I'm glad you saw value in my large driveway plenty big enough for 4 cars. I glad you appreciated my prompt response to your inability to read the listing. I'm glad I could be availible for such a gracious woman. You will go far in life with your wonderful disposition. Thank you for seeing value and being grateful!

VICKY: (host)'s place is a great place for a family to stay in. However, the house could be a little cleaner. The floor is not perfectly cleaned and some of the towels are obviously not washed. Other than that, the place is perfect for a family trip.

HOST: Im glad you appreciated me bringing you fresh towels in less then 20 min of you checking in. Even though the towels I removed had obviously been freshly laundered I gave service with a smile. I'm glad you appreciated me cleaning the floor with a paper towel in one 2 inch area that had a smudge. I'm glad that you enjoyed your stay at my very clean home. I'm glad that you,appreciated that I messaged you everyday to make sure everything was perfect. I'm glad you appreciated the fact that I live minutes away. I'm glad you appreciated the large table for your large family to eat as one. I'm glad your children enjoyed playing in the yard and in the nearby parks. Thanks for being a great great full guest and being able to see things as they are instead of what you imagine.

________________

ARIEL: Though the place was exceptionally clean and secure the rules were unclear. All rules should be stated on the main page. I read the rules listed on the posting, so when I had questions it seemed to upset the host and he assumed that I had not bothered to read the instructions even though I did (he later sent me these rules in an airbnb message and text). It would be very helpful for guests if all rules were listed in the main posting and not in separate messages or texts. I was stressed that I would mess up the unwritten rules and upset the host. Receiving texts (during the day AND very late at night and even after we left the house) and messages with updated rules during my stay there made my trip fairly stressful as I want to do what I can to be a good guest. The other people staying there that night felt the same and we were all asking ourselves what the rules were as it was very unclear. If ALL rules were listed out and clear I would have given 5 stars. The place is very clean, new and nice, and in a great location. The price is excellent as well. I just felt that I was not a guest but someone the host had to ""deal with"".


HOST: you: I'm so glad your room was perfect! Im glad you saw value in I'm glad you appreciated being less then 2 miles from the heart of Monterey. I'm glad you felt good giving to schools with your tax dollars. I'm glad you understand at such a young age that practicing gratitude is being WEALTHY! Enjoy your life and thanks for being a great guests.

In the end, I guess the part that cinched was the reviews on Yelp + Citysearch with regards to his previous contracting work: 

19/7/2011
Forget this Contractor
Mr. (surname) came in his Bermuda shorts and flip flops to view and give me a quote on repairing my old redwood deck. After viewing it and a short discussion where I asked him two or three questions to explain some of his comments, he said """"I think you should get another contractor"""" turned and left and refused to explain himself. 

I have dealt with contractors over 50 years in three countries and have never been treated with such rudeness. 

This man is a prima donna. After reviewing his company on the web I understand he sub-contracts the work and is very expensive, with mixed results. 

Save yourself problems, find a professional, courteous contractor, which he is not.

Contractor from Hell
Refused to return leftover materials from a job I paid for- took materials to another job.

Left us waiting over an hour and fifteen minutes while he parked his Mercedes cargo van in our driveway and knocked door to door soliciting work from our neighbors. 

Workmanship was SHODDY one week after project was finished it rained and my house flooded

When called into question about workmanship we were verbally assaulted and he repeatedly used the term ""N*gger"" and ""B*tch"" in reference to us. Problems have still not been addressed.

Has only references from elderly clients who have told me they don't know if they were being price gouged. 

Charges way too much for simple jobs

BEWARE!!

10/06/2016: 
I sued him and he was COURT ORDERED to pay me $4,818 in damages -- and he's still not paying. He ""changed his mind"" about returning my money after the judgement. When I asked him why he said, ""I gave my life to The Lord Jesus Christ. See you in court you spoiled brat."" 

Then, when he saw this review he wrote me an e-mail that said, ""Thanks for posting online. Now check your credit report!!! Dirty gets dirty.""


TLDR: Decided to forfeit my fee for AirBNB because the reviews creeped me out

This in itself doesn't affect me. However, on the following morning I received a message where tge host told me that during my stay, he would be having visits in the basement that I was using. If I was bothered he would keep those visits very short. They did tell me the time these visits would be occurring at. (during most of the day and around 7:30pm)

While I understand the need for those visits, this makes me extremely uncomfortable for the following reasons :

(a) I feel manipulated in having to accept. I was told after having spent a night, I do not have the time to find another place to stay in such a short notice, and I was left no choice but to accept the visits, even when acknowledging that it made me uncomfortable. The only compromise I had was that they would keep the visits short.

(b) I feel no comfort in using this space. I will be gone most of the day, I have a conference to attend, but in the event that I am not, I cannot enjoy this space, since there's the chance that there may be a visit from strangers during most of the day and even in the evening. I am now carrying most of my valuables I would have preferred to leave in the room.

Is this actually allowed? I had no knowledge before booking and even before checking in. I doubt this was a last minute decision. I understand not trading this as a hotel room, but at the same time I'd expect the decency of being able to enjoy some amount of privacy without the hosts or absolute complete strangers bursting into the space I'm using for a weekend.


Edit: I contacted the host and they told me they would not do the visits. In light of that, should I still contact Airbnb?",0.94,35,1572037119.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/dn3q10/my_host_is_making_visitations_during_my_stay_and/,True,45

adafc6b0-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Pitbull has constant access to supposedly private room,"Hi AirBnB people, I’ve found myself in a predicament which has led me to seek an outside opinion on how to proceed...

Yesterday my girlfriend and I moved into our new AirBnB. We booked the room for about a month. Everything is fine except that upon arriving we were informed by the host that his pit bull must cross through our bedroom via two doggy doors to get outside to go to the bathroom. The listing mentioned that the pit bull lives on the property but made no mention of it being able to enter our room at any time. Frankly I don’t feel comfortable with this (not to mention it’s just annoying when I’m trying to sleep) and am considering asking for a refund.

Has anything like this happened to anyone else? Should the host have disclosed this on the listing? If necessary, do you think AirBnB would side with me if the host refuses to give us a refund? Thanks in advance!


UPDATE:

I talked with the host and he immediately helped out by putting blockers on the pet doors. He probably should’ve done that from the start, but hey, problem solved! Thank you all for the comments. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t crazy for complaining.

And yeah, I wanted to specify that the dog was a pit bull. I would be no less annoyed if it were a beagle stomping through my room at night, but I would certainly feel a little safer. “But it’s the owner not the breed!” Sorry, statistics don’t lie.

adafc818-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Need help summarizing our experience with a lying/manipulative guest for her airbnb review,"I am a Superhost with over 200 bookings in our historic Detroit large home. We live in our home and host using some of our guest bedrooms and a 3rd floor guest suite. Our home has shared space on our first floor. We are also very experienced with hosting private events, photoshoots and more in our home. We typically work out details with photographers in advance to ensure that no other guests are staying in the home so privacy can be ensured. There are over 6 places in our listing that describe how spaces are shared with other guests, and our policy is “no parties” also clearly listed. We basically operate as a high-end bnb with concierge service for our visiting guests and occasionally we get inquiries for shoots which we try to accommodate by requiring they book all rooms, pay an hourly rate, carry insurance, etc.

Our guest T booked our home for 2 nights one month ahead of her arrival date. Her booking message stated “Hi im a photographer and i'll be in detroit for sessions, i can't wait to stay in your stunning space.” I proceeded to confirm with her on her plans and asked if she’d be travelling alone. I got no response to my message.

A month later, the day of her booking, I reached out again and asked her when she’d arrive. T responded that she’d be coming at 9 and asked “Is it okay if I have a few photographers there for a few hours? Im staying by myself, they would just be visiting for a few.” I asked her if they were visiting, or photographing in the home, when she responded that they’d be photographing, I asked for more information on her plans, the number of people, hours of shooting, equipment, etc. T then asked to cancel. When I informed her that she was welcome to cancel but would not be refunded as it was the night of her booking, she told me “Basically I’m just showing up for a few hours, I planned on using the bathroom, and the room with the piano. And everything else would be outside. No equipment other than my camera. It’s very lowkey.” Shooting from “3-5.”

Fortunately our other Airbnb guests weren’t arriving until about 7, so I told her that if she would definitely be out of the home by 5 that it would probably be ok. She agreed and said “ok absolutely” and thanked us.

What happened from then on I’ll describe below. T arrived at 1:30, bringing in a case of water and popsicles with a friend. I was cleaning around the house while she was setting up and when I went to give her a tour, she admitted she had already shown herself around including our personal bedroom and master bath, which she asked if she could have one of her models sit in for photos when they arrived. I said that would be ok. I proceeded to bleach and clean the tub for her.

8 photographers then showed up to our home with 6 models (3 couples) They were in the home from 3-7:20pm when T finally checked out. It was a full photography workshop that she had sold tickets for and arranged Instagram models to arrive. With each couple, the man would take off their shirt and all 8 photographers proceeded to shoot them all over the home, including one of our other Airbnb guests bedroom, on top of our kitchen counters, couches, piano, sunroom, and then out on our front lawn under our sprinkler (T asked to use the sprinkler)(I’m sure our neighbors were getting a strange view that day) In our bathroom T made a bubble bath and a couple climbed in with the girl in a bralette and man shirtless. They left their used towels all on the floor and didn’t rinse out the tub when they were done.

At every turn, T’s small requests and statements were at best what I’d call “half truths” that ended up taking advantage of us, our generosity, and our space. As a superhost, I am motivated to become very deferential and work to say “yes” to as many requests as possible once a booking is confirmed in order to avoid bad reviews. I work very hard to accommodate our guests needs, and at first I thought T was simply communicating a little poorly, but by the end I feel as though T took advantage of the situation by constantly making manipulative small requests and proceeding to abuse the courtesies we gave her. We have had many photoshoots in our home, including a photoshoot for burlesque dancer. I don’t have a problem with shirtless men in my home, I don’t have a problem with photoshoots, but I do have a problem with the lack of transparency and honesty. Had T responded to my first message and had told me her ACTUAL plans instead of all of the half-truths, I’d have had no problem and we’d have worked out clear agreeable terms to accommodate her. She was lucky she happened to book a day in our home where other Airbnb guests (an elderly couple) weren’t already checked in or arriving earlier… otherwise I’d say her plans were anything but “lowkey.”

So that's basically the whole story in a nutshell, albeit a large nutshell. I want to give her an honest review so that others can avoid this scenario with her. She booked us instantly, which in the past people planning on shooting in the home have always sent inquiries first, a courtesy for us to discuss plans and terms.

UPDATE:Used a lot of this input to develop my review of her and injected actual quotes from her on the airbnb messaging app and showing how dishonest she was with her intentions... I also screen capped everything she posted to instagram about her workshop in my home and our security cam of her leaving over 2 hours past agreed time. I received a glowing 5-star review from her and when she read the one she received from me, she has been BLOWING UP my DMs in a rage for the last hour. She made her bed, now she'll have to lie in it.

adafc980-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Fraudulent Airbnb guest,"So I had a reservation with this russian guest, she wanted checked in at 2am in the morning even if it's not allowed but since I live close to my appartment I chose to let them in.

Tomorrow morning she sends me a message requesting that the appartment should be cleaned, I refused because the appartment is always clean after the checkout of a guest and before their arrival. She had a reservation for 15 days but on the 9nth she sends me a message that she can't take it anymore and that she would leave because the conditions are horrible,I tried to convince her to stay and tried to understand the problem but she refused and already prepared her departure in advance without security seiing them.

&#x200B;

Today I get a request from her that she wants to get refunded, she wrote a 18 lign paragraph full of lies about the condition of the appartment and sent photos as proof, well in the photos the appartment is clearly dirty, and that is because she made it dirty on pupose, she soiled the bathroom and the kitchen on purpose and now she wants a refund.

This is clearly a scam to get airbnb for free, just like what they do with uber and ubereats, they claim that this and that was missing or incorrect or they say it was unsanitary and get refunded.

adafcc50-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Terrible experience in Chile... help needed,"Hello. I'm about to share an ongoing personal experience, partly because I wanna get it off my chest, to get some ideas and also maybe to warn others. Some friends, family and I have used Airbnb before and it's always been great. This is rather exceptional but it's been really horrible.

So two weeks ago I booked a whole apartment for myself to stay in Santiago de Chile. I already know the city, I know the building where the listed place is located and the pictures looked great. I sent my reservation request and the hostess, ""Emilia"", accepted it right away. I sent her a message on the platform, which initially she didn't reply to, and then I texted her on Whatsapp through the phone no. that Airbnb gave me.

The first funny thing is that she asked what place I was writing about. I checked and she did have like 4 listings, which immediately made me suspicious that she was managing one of those real-estate home-rental offices (very common in South America). She then told me that I'd be contacted about my check-in soon.

The day before my arrival (last Friday), I received a request from Emilia, on the platform, to **switch me to another place** that she hosted. The place was over half a mile away, looked less nice, and had a lower per-night value; however, the request said I was going to have to pay the same amount of money anyway. I **declined** and wrote to her on the app that the place didn't suit my needs. Soon after, Emilia called me on Whatsapp and proceeded to explain that that day the previous guests had left the place ""with a foul smell, and flooded, and a plumber had to be called""... and that the repairs would take days, and that was the reason for the request to change places. I asked if she was representing a real-estate office, which she confirmed. I openly told her I knew the place had been available for weeks and that I didn't know if I could believe her story and that the other place was not what I desired, the cost didn't seem fair, and I asked her to please cancel my reservation so I'd get my money back. I immediatly made yet another reservation through instant-booking with other hosts in the same building. I also wrote to Airbnb Support team explaning the situtation and asking for a full refund.

The day of my arrival (last Saturday) I went straight to the second place I'd booked. The other hosts were great, I settled in and noticed I'd got a reply from the Support team. They asked which one of the two reservations I'd been denied, I explained again which one it was, and a couple hours later they sent one final message saying the'd contact Emilia about the refund. **They haven't messaged me since Saturday afternoon and it's Wednesday evening now**.

Last Monday I happened to stop by Emilia's apartment, which is **in this same building** and **technically was (still is) booked to me**. **There were people inside**. An elderly lady kindly explained that she'd been there since last week and was staying until next Saturday. Naturally there was no plumber to be found. I tried calling Emilia and she didn't pick up, I texted her on the platform and on Whatsapp and she hasn't replied. I **wrote to Airbnb on Monday** and I explained that I'd discovered how fraudulent the whole thing was, and asked for my money back once more.  
Again, I **wrote to Airbnb on Tuesday**, saying it'd been three days since I'd heard from them, that this was very distressing, I was travelling away from home and I needed the money back.  
Today (Wednesday) I tried using the ""request money"" option on Airbnb for Emilia, but I couldn't choose the whole amount of money I'd paid originally. I tried calling her, texting her... no use. I **messaged Airbnb's Support team for the third day in a row** demanding my money back and that the hostess be penalized.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: one Airbnb host cheated me and I haven't got my money back yet (and I'm paying for two places at once)**

&#x200B;

Why is Airbnb being so passive about this? I am entitled to a FULL REFUND, am I not?  
This is a particularly dishonest case! (The obvious theory is this real-estate agency keeps the Airbnb listing as available even when they book it otherwise, and instead of doing the right thing they tried to move me somewhere else by lying through their teeth). Does anyone have experiences like this one or any ideas on what I should do now?

TLDR; rented a yurt on airbnb right before a rainstorm, host told me I could keep the windows open for fresh air even in the rain, claimed over $2k in damages when the floor got wet.

I was really stressed over this whole thing because 1) I could not afford that charge and 2) Airbnb's responses kept implying I was in the wrong. I stopped emailing them asking for updates after a few weeks because their response was usually ""you have a responsibility to leave the rental as you found it"".

I also realized that the photos they sent as ""evidence"" of the floor bubbling up weren't even near the windows where the rain had gotten in. I'd noticed mold on the outside/some bubbles inside when I got there but figured yeah it's a yurt in the woods, so..

After two months airbnb finally emailed me back and said they decided I was responsible for the damage and the incident would stay flagged on my account. However I would not be charged anything.

I'm glad I didn't have to pay since I was told multiple times to keep the windows open. But lessons learned:

- Just close the damn windows if it's going to rain even if someone tells you not to.

- Always take pictures of any damage when you arrive and do a walk through with the hosts.

- Keep all communication on airbnb app. Even if they said it was my fault, I still think the host's in-app message telling me to keep the windows open helped my case.

- really just close the fucking windows and avoid all the trouble completely.

Also never booking through airbnb again because it was really not worth the stress. I'm so curious what they paid out the hosts because I was already planning on returning to that rental and had raved about it to a ton of friends. Obviously don't think I'd be welcome back now. 😅",0.88,35,1546576267.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/acegws/update_my_host_claimed_damages_because_rain_got/,True,14

edit3: airbnb finally closed my claim with no payment. i offered to provide the signed statement from my maid attesting to the condition of my property before the last guest's stay but it didnt seem to matter. damages came in lower than I originally estimated - after getting a few more estimates to repair the floor, the total damages were \~$1,100. im going to continue on with arbitration (which they never let you know that you have the right to an independent arbitration of the incident - you need to read the ToS and invoke this right yourself). ill update in a few weeks/months with how that process turns out. thanks everyone who provided helpful advice. for now, im pulling my listing from AirBnB - I personally do not feel adequately protected against potential damages AirBnB guests can cause and had always based my decision to host AirBnB guests bc I thought I would be protected by their guarantee.

***edit4: Biggest frustration I have had with airbnb as a host on this issue - you are not allowed to speak to a trust and safety representative on the phone. The entire department forces all communication through written form for ""trust"" - i.e. they do not actually answer any of your questions, conversations are async, huge delays in responses, vague/unclear responses, and every rep response is from some different representative.***

edit5: they ignored my demand for arbitration, lol? [https://imgur.com/QRpNGsW](https://imgur.com/QRpNGsW)

***edit6: Once the legal department got my formal demand from the AAA, I was able to speak to an awesome lawyer from AirBnB's legal team ON THE PHONE about my case. We were able to resolve it within 5 minutes and AirBnB agreed to pay for my damages in full including my AAA arbitration demand consumer submission fee for agreeing to withdraw the AAA arbitration demand. They apologized for how the case was handled. I really appreciated the professionalism from that department. It was the first time that I felt someone actually read through my correspondences top to bottom. I would edit the title if I could. I no longer feel their Host Guarantee is a scam.

I am a relatively new host \(had 15 guests already\), who's currently hosting a couple that booked on very short notice, 1 day in advance. I haven't had that until now. Changed the settings already. That wouldn't be the issue though. The true problem is, that they are very demanding from second 1 on.

They were the first one out of 15 who didn't manage by themselves to type in the adress that i provided into google maps, after I sent them images of my front door  \(that are on the app already\),  a ""location"" to their whatsapp and a 10 minutes phone call, they still didn't manage to ring the bell \(also a first one\). I had to come to the front door opening the door for them. They asked for access to the kitchen, which my rules state isn't part of the deal. They asked me if it's okay to smoke in the room, which again, is also stated in the rules is not allowed. They didn't manage to turn on netflix by themselves and asked me to come over to help. They didn't mange to turn on the washingmachine by themselves and asked for an introduction. Which I had to give them 2 times. The first time when I showed it to them and the second time 1 hour later when they really used it. They asked me what to do that evening, I gave them 2\-3 restaurant ideas and sight seeing ideas and I showed them the maps, the lonley planet that is on the bed for free, and they said ""no no, that's why we have you for."" pardon me? After that they still asked to make hot water and coffee in the kitchen despite I already told them no. I gave in on this one, since it was too exhausting to tell them again no. So, yes, my fault.

They asked for extra stuff that is no where mentioned. Like a cable\-converter for the wall socket, that I had by pure chnance, and an electric iron, despite not having a iron board or at least a table in their room ""we will manage to do it in their bed"". uhm, nope. I said i checked, and the iron is broken.

This all happend yesterday **in one single afternoon**.

Also when I woke up I noticed that the shared toilette is full of dirty shoe prints. Which unfortunately I cleaned reflexively and don't have any pictures of.

So at this point I am not sure anymore if this is a test to see how far I will go, or if they are really serious. Since I only had normal guests with small requests before I am overwhelmed by their attitude. How to proceed here? Where does my duty as a good host stop?

Edit: Oh, and by the way. I provided free nespresso capsuales, and they didn't manage to make the coffee. Just made a mess. Which \(almost obviously\) wasn't cleaned up by them.",1.0,38,1526293944.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8jb81z/how_much_requests_from_a_guest_are_too_much/,True,43

After I refused, his tone became threatening, so I reported to Airbnb. Saying things like ""I'll have apartment ready just for you."" 

Airbnb refused to do anything about it, and suggested that I cancel the reservation, meaning that the host would face no penalties nor even have the review showing that he cancelled a reservation.

Finally after being assured by Airbnb that they would not cancel the reservation, I agreed with a customer support agent to cancel the reservation, since I did not trust host to not cancel reservation at last second, or try to make my trip a nightmare in some other way.

After I cancelled, I received gloating from the host, as he stated ""Haha, that's what I thought small fry.""

NOW:  We got tossed to a second CM because our first one was leaving work.  The second one is not responsive and has now flat out lied to us (stating they would charge the guest by 4pm today, 8 hours ago) while also telling the guest they can try to offer to pay less than they owe.  What The Actual Fuck.  AirBnB is looking a case where there is clear evidence (and a confession) that a guest brought twice as many people to the listing to scam the host out of money and they are siding with the guest.  Even encouraging the guest to try to talk us into giving a discount for attempting to scam us!!?

My property manager called me asking to turn it back on. I let him know to tell the guest that Netflix is not and has not been offered and they must be using someone else's account without knowing. I declined to start a new account for the home, as it was never included or mentioned in the description. Guest states that since it was there when they moved in, I should continue it and has threatened to leave a negative review if I do not. While not in the description, I mention in the guest book how to use the Roku box and to be sure to log out at the end of their stay if they log into any apps. My property manager ended up creating a free trial account to close the gap until they move out. We'll sort out the wording in the description before the next guest, as well as briefing the cleaning person on how to log out of any open apps. 
Am I crazy for thinking the guest is beyond reasonable expectations or would you feel the same if you came to a rental and had the same situation?

I knew this was not correct because the policy explicitly says you can discriminate for any legal reason, and in the United States you can legally discriminate based on the city residency of a guest. 

U/jrossetti posted screenshots of Airbnb agents confirming what he said. That made no sense - as the agents were not the folk who would actually know how to distinguish between what is legal and what is not. So I contacted Airbnb and directed my question to their legal department. 

It took much longer for them to respond as a result, but I finally got the definitive word today - discriminating against local city residents does NOT violate their non-discrimination policy.

Raised my rent by $600 and turned the lower unit into an Airbnb. Didn't ask or tell me. I found out when the first guests arrived and were lost. It was 10pm and they spoke no english. I ended up helping them get situated, put a new lightbulb in that had burnt out and argued with them about giving them my wifi password. I am pretty pissed. Since then new people show up to stay every 3 to 5 days. I feel unsafe, especially for that time when my kids get home from school and I haven't gotten home from work.

She has one positive review from 2014.

""""How perfectly aggravating this is, but ever resourceful me (ok, rebellious) has been to the rodeo. Should you choose, please search me as ""Blankettyblank"". Georgia number. Anyway, if you can, do. If not, I'll try to type tomorrow. My OA is killing me. Nite.""

Here IS the real issue though. I called Airbnb to report what looks likely to have been a pattern of taking hosts off platform since her first rodeo in 2014. My rep told me there was no protocol to report this. Until I have an active reservation with a guest, there is not a mechanism to report this activity! But....wait....what?! I challenged respectfully and veeeery gently, restated, reiterated, retreated and started again.....nope. How can I report an account-holder who WON'T BE MAKING A RESERVATION BECAUSE SHE'S SPECIFICALLY FISHING FOR REMOVING THE RESERVATION FROM YOUR PLATFORM?! You literally cannot report this activity specifically! I mentioned also that I have been contacted by Airbnb in the past when they detected that a user had offered me alternative communication, so it seems as if they might like very much to be made aware, but she stood by her assertion that you cannot directly report this inquiry or account-holder to be investigated.

My guest had more people than allowed in my apartment, unbeknownst to me, and kept neighboring units awake until 5am. In fact, they blatantly lied about how many people were coming in their initial message. I asked them to leave and called Airbnb to cancel the reservation because of this violation.

The agent on the phone informed me that the guest would be refunded the full amount of the remaining night (Saturday night). It’s already 12pm and I’m out of runway for rebooking this apartment.

How the hell can Airbnb penalize the host for such a blatant infraction by the guests?  Can something like this be escalated to ensure the hosts are protected and aren’t losing out on revenue for guests being dishonest?

Edit: This was a new guest with 0 reviews. I’m a super host with over 1700 reviews across 15 listings. Airbnb should feel they make more money from me than the new guests, right?  Not to say guests are less important, but this doesn’t seem right.

It's a townhouse with a 4 car driveway (parked front to back and side to side) on the host's side of the property.  It's the same on the neighbor's side except that you have to park partially on the footpath and the driveway to fit 4 cars as well.  Tight squeeze with just a couple of inches to spare.

Sunday I worked an extended night shift, was dead tired, got back to the house at 5am, went to bed soon after and thought I could sleep Monday morning in peace.  Then suddenly at 7am I get woken up by the doorbell ringing.  I look outside from the street facing bedroom window (roof blocks the view to the front door though), I don't see anyone, don't see an obvious emergency like a fire, etc. , so roll over and try to go back to sleep.  10-15 mins later again...ding dong ding dong ding dong...I'm thinking WTF! maybe it IS urgent.   So I get dressed, exhausted and go downstairs to the front door, open it and find an irate old woman who's demanding to speak with the homeowner and asking me who I am.  I'm thinking I don't know who this woman is, I'm still half asleep and I don't want to reveal too much , so I say I'm visiting and the host is away.  She asks where, I repeat she's away.  The woman, in broken English, starts yelling at me to move a car that's parked right to the edge of the driveway (still on my host's property) because she claims that she can't park her car and the neighbor's son's car side by side without hitting the host's parents' car on the shared driveway without damaging it.  

I do notice the old woman has a handicap sticker on the car and the bumper is already damaged..but she was able to walk..maybe she just has some disability and trouble parking..who knows.  The old woman was yelling at me to move the host's car or the host's parents' car which are parked right to the edge of the property line.  I don't have keys to either and told her that.  The woman suggests I move her car to ""show her"" that 2 cars can be parked side by side on the neighbor's side and still open the door..but I declined a few times.  I didn't want to get in the woman's car and be then falsely accused of something like damaging it.  Instead I tried to help the woman by directing her to position her car right to the edge of the footpath so she could park her car and her son's side by side and still open the door (just not open wide) and she's having none of it. Stubborn and irate, she yelled at me, ""what do you want to do?  fool me?""  As if I am BSing her when I just wanted to help.  Since I was fatigued and irritated, I got visibly upset, just as another neighbor walked down the sidewalk and witnessed the incident, so I'll probably hear about it when the host returns...look a rude airbnb guest arguing with a neighbor, causing trouble, etc. when in fact I felt like I was being attacked, not vice versa.



**TL;DR - Would you report this neighbor conflict incident to the host and/or post in the review, or let it go?**   I don't want to have to check out early but the last thing I need is the neighbor's mother to come damage my car out of spite.

I’m in San Diego.   Southern California is a never ending metropolis, but we aren’t known for our public transit.    Sad but true.    Of course you can stay in a neighborhood that is walkable or does have public transit.    That is not, however, what I’m offering.    I actually did live in one of those areas, then I had the opposite problem.   People would complain about the location for traffic and parking.   

In my first paragraph of my listing I specify that I live in a residential neighborhood, that it’s not walkable to anywhere, and that public transit is not realistic.   

Later in the “Neighborhood” “Overview and Getting Around” I detail that It’s 15 minute walk to the bus.    It will take over an hour to get to the beach by bus, but by car it’s 9 minutes (less than 5 miles) to one of the highest rated beaches in the country.    Uber and Lyft are pretty affordable and always within 5 minutes for pickup.    Parking is also free and abundant on my street.   My house is on a cul-de-sac so it’s really quiet.  

I also include exact distances to different popular attractions.   

When guests book I assume they didn’t read any of the listing so I highlight the location specifics again in my welcome message.    I keep it short in hopes they won’t skip over this reading as well.   I also make it read like it’s not a canned message and I let them know they can cancel.   

Still the most common ding I get in my star ratings is for location.    The only thing I can think to add is a picture that adds to the already redundant description of my location.

I luckily found him chilling outside on the porch and when I mentioned how oops! he locked me out of the bathroom, can he please open it, he was dismissive.

Fast forward a few days and guess what?  He did it again!  Except this time it's currently night time and I can't go pounding on the other guest's bedroom door possibly waking him up to ask can he please unlock the bathroom door again?!   I noticed there is a spare toilet on the ground floor but I officially don't have access to it.  It's also protected by an undisclosed camera that's not in the listing.  I think the host set up the camera to check if any guests use that extra toilet, when not authorized to do so.

I have 4 nights left on this reservation and don't want to rock the boat too much by tattling on this 1 inconsiderate guest , nor post a bad review for the host when the guest's bad behavior isn't her fault but it's not fair that I'm being locked out of the only bathroom I'm paying for, and need, especially at night / in the morning.   One more thing: the other guest also woke me up at 5:25am on a workday morning when I don't normally get up until 2-3 hours later by clearing his throat and spitting in the sink of our shared bathroom multiple times and then doesn't clean the sink after his spitting. Gross! 

Who should I approach and how?  Message the host, talk to the other guest again?  I've had it with the rudeness and can't afford to lose sleep over this especially during the workweek.",0.96,38,1558505788.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/brl75b/guest_locked_me_out_of_shared_bathroom_was/,True,43

adafefd2-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Careless Airbnb Guests,"Hi,

I’m new to Airbnb as a host. I had decided to rent out my condo, provided a lockbox with key attached to the door. Most guests have been wonderful but I had this young couple book one night for a concert. Now, I have an app that tells me when my door is locked unlocked. It was 9:30 pm I saw that they had left, the door was left unlocked for about an hour. 

I was slightly irked because there’s obviously my things at risk with them doing that and locked the door. 

I wake up the next morning and see Airbnb messaging me, the guest messaged me, they had left the key inside instead of taking it with them to top off leaving the door unlocked. Had to take a night in a hotel. I had remotely unlocked the door, they go in and grab their things, shower, and leave and left the front door unlocked AGAIN after check out. 

Airbnb is asking if I’m willing to contribute to a refund. Even with a hotel you always make sure you have the key with you. They clearly didn’t care about leaving my things at risk. What do you guys think?",0.91,36,1554989278.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/bbzvaq/careless_airbnb_guests/,True,46
adaff13a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Host angry at not eating breakfast,"I booked an AirBnB in Sweden about two months ago for  me and my boyfriend (only 3 nights), and the description of the bnb was very minimal - it looked nice, and the host was a super host, but it also specifically said it was a one room reservation with a separate bathroom and didn't say anything about guest/host interaction. It did say breakfast included, but specified that it was just some items in the kitchen that you could make yourself (no cooking).

By bf and I just got back to the bnb for our last night here, and as we're heading to our room the host stops us and is clearly upset. He's very offended that we didn't eat any of his food for breakfast and that we haven't talked to him. Thing is, we've been spending all day out and about because that's why we're here and we didn't want to eat all his food because it seemed like it was his own food that he was just sharing with us. We chatted a bit when we checked in, but we didn't think he was here any of the other times we've been in and out. Most of the doors in the apartment are closed so we figured he didn't want us poking around, and he wasn't in any of the public spaces (kitchen, living area). We were very confused and tried to apologize, but he wouldn't accept it and just walked away.

We're pretty uncomfortable staying here our last night because we no longer feel welcome at all. We're also not sure if we should leave first thing in the morning or if we should try to apologize again instead and skip our pre-flight brunch plans.

*EDIT: For anyone interested, this is what happened after the original post: We got up very early and left because we no longer felt comfortable around him. We cleaned up our room as much as possible and followed his check out instructions, then sent him a message apologizing again for any misunderstandings, and saying that we'd checked out early because we didn't want him to feel as uncomfortable as we were and we wanted to avoid any problems that might arise.

He responded saying the problem wasn't the breakfast (which is explicitly what he had been very upset about the night before), but that we didn't talk to him. Apparently there was a single time, out of all the times we went in and out, that he was in the living room and he was very offended that we didn't say hi before we left that day. Thing is, I specifically remember that the door to the living room was closed that day. Why would he close the door if he wanted to talk to us?

He was also upset that we didn't respond to his message with directions to his apartment. I understand why he'd be upset about that, but he only sent it the day before we got there so we were busy with travelling (also my phone doesn't have data abroad so I neither got the message when he sent it, nor could I respond quickly because I rarely have wifi). The message he sent was also copy/paste from the listing, so it wasn't a personal message. Every other host we've stayed with sent me instructions weeks ago. We arrived on time (I told him when I made the reservation that we'd arrive at his check-in time), and we didn't expect to see him because he said he may or may not be there.*",0.96,38,1554241605.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/b8pf8e/host_angry_at_not_eating_breakfast/,True,21

Upon waking up after the first night multiple friends woke up with beg bug bites all over their bodies and we managed to find some after inspecting the beds.

We contacted the host right away and his remediation was to close the door to the affected room and allow us to stay in the remainder of the home for the rest of our stay. OBVIOUSLY we declined, bed bugs cannot be contained in this manner.

Since we did not stay nights 2 & 3 the host refunded us. He refused to refund night 1 so escalated this to Air bnb. 

After speaking with air bnb multiple times they let us know that since accepted a refund on nights 2 & 3, it was left up to the host to decide whether or not he wanted to refund night 1.

We paid over $1000/night, had to wash all of our clothes and luggage, find last minute accommodations and a had a terrible experience all around. One of my friends even had a terrible allergic reaction to the bites.

adaff75c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Guests encountering unfortunate circumstances and wanting refunds - Hosts, what do you do?","When things go wrong on a vacation, it sucks and costs money. 

I’ve recently had a spate of cancellations last minute due to varying out-of-their-control issues that happened to guests (well tbh it happens frequently, and always has, over the last 4 years of hosting). 

I have a strict cancellation policy in place. When a guest has to cancel, and they write to ask if I can please refund them, my standard reply is that if someone else books the room, I will happily reimburse them for what I receive (many times it’s less than what they paid since it is a same-day booking). 

I feel like this is a fair response. However, I have frequently had guests get quite angry with me, as since what caused the cancellation wasn’t in their control, they don’t feel they should have to pay for the room since they can’t show up. 

Why do so many people think that it’s ok to offload their personal crisis and financial burden onto another human? They are literally asking me to take from my pockets to pay for their crappy situation. No it’s not their fault, but it certainly wasn’t mine either! And refunding you when the room wasn’t able to be booked by someone else due to your late cancellation, it becomes MY loss, which means my rent is compromised... due to someone else’s unfortunate circumstance. I mean, I’ve got enough of those happening on my own to manage...

But if the room rebooks, hey, I’m totally fine with returning money - I’m not interested in making double bucks off of other people’s bad luck. 

How many other hosts have run into this? Do you handle it differently? Do you just eat their money loss for their trip issues? 

I will confess I’m a bit raw as I recently had a fellow host ream me out in a review because weather cancelled her ferry and she couldn’t make it over to stay in the room. She cancelled after 10 pm the night of, not even a chance for someone else to book (my cut off is 10 pm.) Thankfully Airbnb actually removed her review (that’s a first for me!) likely because she tore into me as a terrible human being even after acknowledging that she cancelled and that my cancellation policy didn’t cover her.

Background, I was a superhost, perfect reviews, 80 something reservations over three properties. Meet all guests personally, show them around, point em to friends businesses, pick up tickets for them, whatever

Every run in I’ve had with their customer service has been awful, though, a couple pretty serious cases where they accepted fault 100% and ended up compensating me etc for staff lying to me/not doing what they promised and putting me in compromising positions. Received a warning email about “creating an environment” back in August. Was subsequently told to ignore it as the case manager listened to the calls, told me I did nothing wrong, and reprimanded the agent in question.

This time round, I’d been hung up on/passed around/lied to for about a week on two open hard drug use cases in my listing. Passed back and forth between trust and safety and CS. Just wanted some accountability. I have transcripts here and time stamps for every phone conversation I had, every lie I was told, every hang up. Definitely, twice, I have gotten frustrated and raised by voice at agents, but nothing to warrant permanently terminating a superhost Account. Woke up the other morning to an email from trust and safety saying they were nuking the account, all upcoming reservations (20 something) cancelled, all upcoming travelling trips cancelled.

I will no longer have to worry about the fake review which made it sound like my house was in war torn Syria.  I won't go in to detail about the finding but you can guess what they said when she didn't send pics and I did.  

Against the sober judgement of the Internet, I did alert who I THOUGHT was this lady's employer, since she had claimed it was on her business trip, because she seems to be abusing company resources I thought.  However, it turns out that the company she claims to work for in her Facebook profile never hired her.  The fact she's sporting their uniform and carrying on like that's where she works has them VERY keen to find her IRL and ask her some questions too.  Immediately after the matter was resolved her facebook self-destructed.  There's no trace of her on there now.  I went ahead and gave the company 5 stars for actually taking it seriously though.  I'm wondering if she's got more than one scam going on now.  

I don't think I'll be seeing her ever again.  She was last seen on the other side of town sleeping on someone's couch instead of the queen bed she turned down.  Probably to save face after she got caught leaving her bogus review... and pretending to work at a company she's never worked for...

Some lady shows up to her reservation and claims the room is filthy, roaches everywhere, uninhabitable, should be condemened, isn't fit for dogs.  I'm like, uh.... are you at the right house?

So I leave work, get there, she's gone already, the room is fine.  Its totally clean, no bugs dead or alive, no landfill smells.  I'm like, okay, maybe I'm crazy so I got 3 other guests to back me up that the room was fine no weird smells or bugs sighted anywhere else.  

She's like ""I took pictures that I'm going to send to airbnb and post in the review"" and I ask her what I can do to make the room more comfortable and if I could see the pictures so I know what part of the room she thought was dirty. She refused.  

""This is the worst Air BNB experience I have ever had! I have had nothing but good stays when I travel to SA but this was absolutely a nightmare. You need to be investigated by the city or the county for condemning the residence ""

So here's the thing.  I found her Facebook and she actually lives here in San Antonio.  So wtf is going on?  Is this some kind of scam or something?  Has anyone experienced anything like this before?

##Update:  Turns out, this lady only has 1 other good review from someone in my neighborhood with a VERY similar listing and setup.  All very basic economy rooms around the $20 range.  Hers are actually a lot cheaper than mine, but she doesn't provide some of the services I do like video games.  So I'm wondering if maybe she's the client. 

Anyway, I thought this would be a very open and shut case.  I sent them pictures of the room as it was and she has no pictures afterall but did leave a crazy review almost identical to her original insults.  Air BnB on their first pass was like, ""We think you should refund her anyway in the spirit of air bnb!"" and they also refused to remove her review.  I told them to escalate it because it if weren't for their TOS I'd be sueing her for slander and libel.  I don't mind real criticism, but its obviously a fake review.

I'm pretty new to AirBnb and I had this one bad experience. I was looking for an AirBnB in Spain and I filtered my search so that I get a room with AC because I know it's very hot in Spain and I can't sleep without AC on. I found a place where I had to share an apartment with the host. On the first day, I asked the host if I can use the AC because it was clearly advertised as having AC. The host said I can use it. The next day, I came back home to rest for a bit and turned on the AC and host sent me a message saying I can't turn on AC during the day because electricity is expensive in Spain. The host said that s/he will program it for a few hours at night only. The thing is, the host comes back home around 2AM every day and I go to bed around 10:30PM so I just turned it on before I went to bed. I think the host was pissed from this. On the last day of my stay, the host intentionally switched off the AC from the circuit breaker (I took a picture of it) so I can't turn it on before the host comes back home. I didn't switch it back on because I didn't want to have an argument with the host. But srly, if the host wasn't cool with me using the AC s/he shouldn't have advertised the place as having AC under amenities. Anyways, it completely ruined my sleep on the last day and I was so tired the next day.

1. 2 years ago I bought heated mirrors for 4 of my bathroom mirrors. they are called defoggers, cost about 50 bucks and stick to the back side of a mirror to run electricity through to create enough heat to prevent condensation from occuring on the mirror. 
2. because i'm not super rich, in order to install this luxury for myself and my guest, I couldn't really afford to run the wires from the light switch to the mirrors through the wall without major reconstruction. so the power supply is run on the outside of the wall covered by plastic wire tracks. 
3. some dumb airbnber called claiming it was a surveillance device. 
4. I set them photos of the bathroom, the mirror, the defogger in action, I took off the mirror and showed it wasn't a one sided mirror, I sent them photos of the defogger, the back of the mirror, I then installed a sign explaining the defogger and sent them that photo, I sent them a copy of the receipt, and then some. 
5. most of that was sent days ago, they individual responding is taking a full 24 hours min to respond. sometimes as much as 48 hours. I think intentionally. 
6. they have cost me 1000's of dollars already and another week will cost me another 1000 more. 
7. Defoggers don't go against airbnb policy and I need help. airbnb won't connect me to a manager, they won't let me talk to anyone else in the trust and safety team. they are bullying me into trying to take down a luxury item. 

I""m going crazy. please advise. I've also informed them that my business can't take 6 more days of being unlisted.  but I don't think they care.

Some of Airbnb’s terms and the way it presents its prices breach the bloc’s unfair commercial practices directive, the unfair contract terms directive and the regulation on jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters, the EU executive said.

...

“But popularity cannot be an excuse for not complying with EU consumer rules. Consumers must easily understand … how much they are expected to pay for the services and have fair rules for example on cancellation of the accommodation by the owner,” EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in a statement.

The company has until the end of August to present its proposals for responding to the criticism which will then be reviewed by the Commission and national consumer authorities. It could face fines if it does not comply with EU rules.

The EU executive said Airbnb should state whether accommodation is offered by a private individual or a professional, provide details of the price in a clear way and modify its terms of service to make them fairer to consumers.

adb002b0-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Nearly 80% of Airbnb Listings in Japan Removed - New Rules Take Effect 15 June,"Extract from traveller.com.au: Just over a week before a new law for minpaku (private lodging services) goes into effect, the popular rental website Airbnb has dropped nearly 80 per cent of its listings for the services over the past three months.

As of March, Airbnb, Inc. had over 62,000 properties in the country available for rental. But according to Hollywis LLC, a Kanagawa-based research firm that analyses the minpaku sector, that number has dropped to 13,800 as operators get ready for the law that will govern their services, and which will go into effect on June 15. Many properties listed on Airbnb were suspected of operating illegally or semi-legally.

On its website, Airbnb informed homeowners that it would not display their listings until they showed they had official permission to operate. When owners show they are in compliance with the new law, their rooms will be posted on the website again.

The large drop in the number of Airbnb listings comes amidst national efforts to crack down on illegal private lodgings and local efforts to place tougher restrictions on how, when and where legal facilities may operate.

The new law requires that homeowners register their rental properties with the local government, which will conduct fire and safety checks before issuing approval. On June 1, the Japan Tourism Agency sent a notice requesting that minpaku operators cancel reservations with facilities that were unregistered.

This is because listings are suspended if they ever reach 4 or below, or if they simply have too many reviews that at 4 or below. Many well intentioned guests, satisfied with the experience here have left a 4 star rating, not understanding how Airbnb penalizes hosts whenever they do not receive 5 stars. In truth, it is better not to leave a rating at all with the way Airbnb currently curates the system. At my home, I aim to provide a low cost experience as to allow travelers on a budget to find a clean and functional place to rest. It is not luxurious, but it is truly, I believe, the best that can be had at this price point.  

If you have any issue at all that makes you feel as if you need to detract from your rating, please let me know before you rate and hopefully I will be able to reconcile your concerns. 

Finally when rating any Airbnb in which you may find yourself, if the host did provide ample service and excelled in any way, please be generous with your ratings. It means a great deal.

Thank you.""






Let me know if you believe there are any ways to improve this note. Thanks!

adb006de-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Airbnb's ""Business"" service is a complete useless joke - My advice, AVOID!","So I've run my own small business for several years, I use Airbnb a lot for company travel for both myself and my employees because it allows them to stay in small towns and villages where the work is based, and there may not be hotels, and it's also reasonably priced.

Recently after lots of advertising, offers and pushing I signed up for Airbnb business and listed all my employees accounts along with my own under the business tab. At first everything was going great, staff were travelling around the world, super happy because they love staying with hosts and having their own apartments or bringing their family, friends and pets to stay with them whilst they work. 

Then last week I went to extend a reservation for one employee in an apartment she'd been staying in for a week, and Airbnb blocked the extension. They said ""first we want to prove you own this card"", LOL WHAT?!?! My company card I've been using with you for years?!?! In my name??! So they made 2 temporary authorisations to the card and asked me to type in the amounts, easy enough... But here in the UK many banks don't show you temporary authorisations on your statements!! They won't even tell me on the phone, there's no way to know until I get my statement at the end of next month...

It gets worse, [Airbnb gives you an alternative verification option of submitting them a bank statement...](http://i.imgur.com/pElCavS.png) Sounds like a massive privacy violation to me, especially when I'm already 110% verified and legit. So I reluctantly send off my bank statement PDF in the box they specify, and [they send me an email to confirm it has arrived, and they'll verify it **within 24 hours**](https://i.imgur.com/7HCRgKH.png) and I'll be able to reapply and make the extension again, or bookings in general. During this time your Airbnb account is placed in a ""limited"" state and you can't make any new bookings, extensions or use any new cards for yourself or any of your employees if you have a business account.

So I wait 24 hours getting extremely nervous, because this employee is a vulnerable young woman in a remote Spanish village, and she desperately needs this apartment extended for our work as there's nowhere else to stay within nearly 50 miles, and no transport either. I also can't make new reservations for my existing staff damaging my business, and it's summer season in Spain too so maybe someone else will book this apartment before I can get the extension in! I can see it's available on Airbnb's website for the days I want, so I'm extremely anxious and not sleeping at all.

Would you know it, 24 hours passes and I hear absolutely nothing from Airbnb. So I call the dedicated business support line and a nice lady answers me. She says the card verifications are a completely different department and customer service can't contact them in any way, or ask any questions, but she will list my verification as a ""priority"" whatever that means.

48 hours passes and still nobody gets back to me, so I offer to extract my employee and bring her back home, but there's only a few days work left so she prefers to pay cash to a local in the village and sleep on their couch... Jesus christ how unprofessional, not to mention violating a load of employment laws, but she wanted that herself.

It's now over a week later and nobody at Airbnb has gotten back to me, and the account is still completely unusable. I've had to shell out tens of thousands of Pounds to my employees in cash to make their own alternative arrangements whilst I try to get this mess sorted. Airbnb is completely unprofessional and not fit for business use at all, **AVOID AT ALL COSTS GETTING A BUSINESS ACCOUNT WITH EMPLOYEES, YOU WILL BE SCREWED BY AIRBNB AT SOME POINT. ALL THE USUAL AIRBNB ISSUES ARE NOW ON STEROIDS AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS USELESS AS USUAL.** 

I wrote to them on Twitter now over a week later and their response is [""We're really sorry for the wait, Thomas. We're experiencing high incoming volume, which is why we're not able to respond as fast as we (1/2)""... ""would like. Rest assured someone will reach out to you as soon as possible.

We just reserved your house in New Orleans for June 22-25th. On your site you said the house sleeps 6. We actually are 7 people (five kids), your house looked just fine and our little one can easily sleep with us. But just wanted to check, before you confirmed us, that you would be ok with that.

This is the second time I've had a family not consider their children as guests. They book and then send a message letting me know they'll have ""extra"" people staying.

Should I be as pissed off as I am? I don't want that many children in my house, but I also don't want to use one of my cancellations just because she doesn't think of her kid as a guest. I find this behavior incredibly rude. Obviously she doesn't understand that instant book is exactly that, instant and the reservation is already confirmed.

adb00b7a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,We're a rental agency. Guest tried to abuse the system and get a refund by complaining about the hot water to airbnb. Customer service emailed us. Here's our response. They ruled in our favor.,"Hi [REDACTED],
Thanks for your email, and for acknowledging how long we've been partners with Airbnb. In fact, we've actually been a provider of high end apartments in [REDACTED] since the 1990's, when vacation rentals were still a small cottage industry. In that time we've learned many valuable lessons, and one of the things we say at [REDACTED] is, ""It's not, IF something happens, it's WHEN."" We say this because when you provide hundreds of reservations in dozens of apartments every year, there's bound for something to happen eventually. Over the years we've had a furnace break in the middle of winter. We've had a forced break-in. And yes, we've had a broken water heater. So we'll be the first to admit when something goes wrong, and we're always proactive about it. Fixing it...offering a refund...offering an upgrade.

As it turns out, we've learned another valuable lesson; ""Take excellent care of the guest"" - believe it or not, when something does go wrong and we make every effort to make it right ASAP, we often earn the gratitude and long term repeat business of that client. We've discovered that people are (usually) very happy when we respond immediately to fix a problem, so in fact we know from first hand experience that taking great care of people is both the right thing to do **and** good business.

So this is why we have well established procedures in place for when a guest reports a problem. First, we immediately dispatch a senior team member to the apartment, which is what we did when [REDACTED] called us. We know that a broken water heater impacts not only the current reservation, but that it can take time to be repaired or replaced, and the next reservation could be impacted too. So we make every effort to get in front of the problem.

However, the bottom line is that there was no problem. We carefully reviewed the hot water system and spoke to [REDACTED] at length, in person. If there had been a legitimate problem, we would have ensured it was fixed immediately or if that was not possible, we would have offered to move [REDACTED] to an upgrade right away (yes, we pay for taxi transportation too). But the reality is there wasn't a problem with the hot water. In fact, the team member that visited the apartment and spoke to [REDACTED] said to her manager, *""Don't be surprised if you hear from her again, I think she's fishing for a refund.""* That's an unfortunate reality of this business; 99% of our guests are honest and trustworthy, but once in awhile we get someone looking to abuse our goodwill. So we will not be offering [REDACTED] a refund.

If you have any further questions, or would like to speak by phone, please don't hesitate to call my cell at [REDACTED].

Very Best,

adb00ce2-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Air BnB host entering apartment/flat to show it to prospective renters (right now),"Help please! Is it normal for the host to come in or send real estate agents to give tours while you're renting? We're staying in an apartment/flat  that seems like a full-time rental (not a lived in home) and they want to give tours or ""viewings"" during our stay. We can't and don't want them to. What should we do?


More detail:
We're (husband, baby and me) on our third day of vacation in London right now. The first morning we were jet lagged and slept in. A real estate agent came in (had a key) unannounced and scared us half to death. He said something like, ""oh, didn't [the host] tell you we were showing it?"" We said no.  He asked how long we were staying and when we said one week he said, ""he doesn't usually tell people if they're only staying a short time."" Then he said he'd come back in five minutes so we could get dressed. We said no. He kept trying to offer to come back in 10 or 15 minutes. We said no. 

When my husband checked his email, there was a one sentence message from the host: ""Are you there right now?"" sent about 30 minutes before the agent came in. He wasn't going to tell us!

He later sent us a message apologizing for the intrusion and said that they would be showing the apartment all week. We said no, we are uncomfortable with that, plus we have a baby who will be taking a nap in the afternoon. We said please reschedule the tours for after we leave.

He sent us a message saying that they had to do tours and ""thanks for understanding."" We replied no, we don't agree with that.

Then Air BnB started messaged us saying he's offering to deduct £15 for every tour. That's nothing because the place is nearly £300/night! My husband was upset and wrote that he shouldn't charge us anything for the days he gave tours. Air BnB messaged back and said he would do £30 per tour. We aren't trying to get money back, we just don't want them to do tours in our place.

This is starting to ruin our dream vacation. It's taking time to go back and forth with Air BnB and we are stressed about the stupid situation. I'm frustrated that Air BnB isn't helping us. I would expect them to tell him he can't do tours.

I don't know what to do. I've thought about just ditching the place and finding a hotel but that would be hard with zero notice, plus the hassle of relocating, not to mention the additional cost.

Update (next day): Thanks everyone for your advice and input!  the Air BnB rep said the host wouldn't bother us anymore. Sounds ominous but I'll take it. ;) I'll update after our vacation.

Update 2 (home from vacation): The rest of our trip went ok. An old man rang our doorbell a few times every morning. There was a camera on the intercom, so we could see who was ringing. Not sure who he was.

Now the host is accusing us of stealing! I will write a different post about that. -_-",0.97,36,1479854803.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/5edrsh/air_bnb_host_entering_apartmentflat_to_show_it_to/,True,19

I told her no pets were allowed and check out time was at 3pm. I hadn't been there when she arrived (I have electronic keypads on the doors) so she probably didn't expect me to be there when she checked out either. When I arrived at 3:30 she and her friend and two entirely new people I had never seen or heard of before were still slowly packing up her car. I noticed a distinct smell of cat litter coming from her room. To be fair, she apologized (once I let her know I knew,) vacuumed everything before she left and the smell aired out after a few hours so whatever, right? Really annoying first guest experience, but not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

But then as I was dumping out the rubbish I noticed mountains of tampon wrappers. As if all 3 women of the 4 people now present had all been on their periods for the past three days. I also noticed the toilet was suddenly getting really clogged really easily.

Sure enough, what does the plumber find clogging up my pipes? A disgusting huge clump of bloody tampon carcasses.

But today I got a call from a very distraught guest. Her and her girlfriend were bitten up head to toe from bedbugs. They and I know this for sure because they were crawling around on the sheets after having a dang feast. You can actually see these fat bastards. 

So began my worst day ever. I immediately went to the property bringing along zip lock baggies to quarantine their things. I called Airbnb and was told by the computer that it would be a half an hour wait. I hung up and contacted them via Twitter, and they responded and called me five minutes later.

The woman I spoke to-Joy- informed me that they would put the ladies in a hotel and reimburse them for their remaining nights. I had her refund the two nights they had already stayed, cause ew bedbugs. 

Joy also let me know that they were canceling my next two guests(6 nights total) and that my listing would be deactivated until they received a letter from a licensed exterminator saying the problem had been resolved. 

I called an exterminator and he was there within the hour. He confirmed the sons of bitches and is coming tomorrow at noon to fumigate/kill every damn living thing in the place. He says I can have the place back four hours after the killing. 400$. Fml.

So I dropped my guests off at a very nice hotel, and proceeded to launder all of their clothing for them. I bought them new suitcases as well. Apparently bedbugs can just hang out on anything soft and fabric-ey. So you have to treat everything or bake it in the dryer on super freaking hot. 

I just got home from dropping off their things at the hotel. I'm pretty sure they brought every article of clothing with them. 6 loads of girl stuff, two large suitcases worth. 11 hours of dealing with this.

I learned a very important lesson today. BUY ENCASEMENTS FOR YOUR MATTRESSES. Mattress AND boxsprings.

High volume host here, booked a place in Mexico for a month to remote work (and I'm not at the beach, it's an actual work trip to Puebla). Apartment is awesome, host gave us a tour and told us we could get wifi details from the front desk. After he left, husband and I went to get them, and discovered they're for the lobby wifi! When we inquired, the host said that they don't book every month, so they don't want to pay for internet and that their previous guests must have purchased mobile wifi. (And that the lobby wifi covers almost the whole ground floor, which is why he checked wifi as an amenity in the listing - the apt is on the 17th floor (those views tho)). The listing includes wifi as an amenity, brand new building so tech limitations aren't an issue (neighbors have wifi), you can get decent places here for $500/mo so it's not a budget accommodation, you can get internet for $25/mo in Puebla when it's a long term contract, and we told the host that we were coming primarily to work from the apartment before booking. The listing has 13 excellent reviews. There are no comparable month long options available and the apartment is otherwise great - suggestions?

Edit Update 7/26:
We researched telcel options and without being a resident, you can't sign up for normal priced service. It would have cost more than the booking to use prepaid hot spots. So this morning I went on AirBnb and somehow a comparable listing had just been posted, so we booked that, packed up and started getting our stuff down to the street. The host kept calling us, we didn't answer (to keep everything in Airbnb messenger), and then he called the building security and kept trying to make them make us take the phone. We refused and told him on AirBnb that that was how we preferred to communicate. Then the guards told us that we had to wait for the host or they would call the police. Given that we're in Mexico, we wanted to get out of there asap, but had too much stuff to fit in one uber. Not wanting to both get hung up with corrupt police (this isn't racism, I love Mexico, but corruption is one of their biggest challenges), I took the stuff and the uber to the new building. The police didn't show up, but the host did with additional security. The host asked my husband to go into a conference room to discuss whether we would be willing to stay - apparently he was unaware until Airbnb told him that it was a problem to list amenities you don't have. He actually told us that he wasn't getting enough bookings and that if he bought internet he'd have to raise his prices, which would mean fewer bookings. Guy literally tried to get us to accept no internet because he couldn't figure out how to make what he was selling cost less than what people were willing to pay. Needless to say, we declined. 

What's really astounding is that Airbnb was acting like we were being totally unreasonable after we gave the host several chances, but then a few minutes ago my husband was on the phone with the case manager and started listing all the things we do to make sure our amenities are all present and working and how far we go for a guest if there's something accidentally wrong. The case manager seemed to come out of a daze and was like, ""Oh wow, yeah you're right!""

Fingers crossed on the next place - it's a brand new listing!",0.92,33,1564021796.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/chhrbb/just_arrived_to_remote_work_from_my_airbnb_but/,True,35

I booked this place cause I needed two things: a room and a shower.  I booked a room in a house where the hosts concurrently live as well as other guests. I just need it while I see out an internship I have a few miles away. It’s been three weeks and I’ve mostly kept to myself. The internship has me working hard and long hours Mon-Fri, so I normally just lock myself in the room as soon as I get back. I don’t really have much energy or time to talk when I get back so that’s why I keep to myself, but when I run into the hosts, I say hi and try to keep the conversations short. 

Today, one of my hosts confronted me saying that I was being too distant. She said that her husband was fine with it, but she wasn’t. She was especially hurt when I didn’t even ask how she was after the earthquakes (currently in CA, earthquakes felt more like little tremors than anything where I’m at) or what she did for July 4th. I tried to clarify that I strictly want to maintain a professional host-guest relationship. She says that it’s her home and she wants me to ask her more about her day and show that I cared about her. Frankly, I don’t. I’m just here for shelter in order to be close to my internship and that’s what I paid for. I told her that this is a business and I paid for the services of a room and a shower and I’m not necessarily trying to make friends in my time here. She said that if that’s so then maybe this isn’t the right place for me to stay because they’re “too warm” for me. I don’t think I’m asking too much. I think she’s asking too much of me to be demanding that I care more about her and such.

Before I get into any more details and make this post longer than it already is, what do you think I should do? I still have 7 weeks left of my internship. Any advice would be very useful and appreciated!

TLDR: First time using AirBnb to be close to internship. 3 weeks in, host confronts me about being too distant and not caring about her. All I’ve done is keep to myself and use the room and shower I’ve paid for.

Edit: I’ve been receiving a lot of messages concerning my social aptitude. I want to clarify that every time I see my hosts or fellow guests, I smile and say hi and engage in small talk but try to keep the conversations short and trivial. I don’t have the energy to ask about their day and act like I care for more than 5-10 minutes. The host in question is very talkative and draining, so that’s why I try to keep conversations short.

Last night around 10:30, 3 police officers show up asking to check on her. They spend almost 3 hours talking to her, and at some point they bring in a female officer to talk to her. Eventually they all leave(her as well).

Then, 4:45am, 2 different officers show up asking to take pictures of the unit for ""evidence"". Just as they showed up, she also comes back, so they leave us alone and go talk to her. We hear some more crying/yelling. Eventually they leave again.

What the hell do we do here? she booked the unit until the 14th. Should we offer to refund her the remainder of her stay if she's willing to leave? the police have not shared any information(citing privacy, which is understandable).

I'm just lost at how to proceed here.

I told her that it would not be possible for us to host more than eight guests due to building regulations, so I would not be able to accommodate the four extra guests.

The guest then cancelled her booking and requested that I pay her back all of the money she was not being refunded by Airbnb for cancelling. As well as expecting me to reimburse her for the Airbnb service fee she paid, she also had the the nerve to ask for extra payment for the inconvenience of having to find new a place the day before her arrival. I fail to see how that is my fault.

I declined the request, only for her to raise a new request for the money. This time she claimed that Airbnb's terms and conditions stated that guests can bring as many guests as they want regardless of the listing's maximum number of guests, so long as the guest was willing to pay.

I declined again, telling her that there was no such rule and I advised her to contact Airbnb if she felt that she had extenuating circumstances entitling her to a refund.

She came back with a third request, so I declined this one and blocked her so that she couldn't send any more.

I thought that would be the end of it other than a phone call from Airbnb asking me if I was willing to refund the guest. Unfortunately I was wrong.

She has now had her friend send me a message claiming that it is clearly stated in Airbnb's terms and conditions that a guest can override a host's maximum number of guests if the guest pays for it and that the host has no say in the matter. Apparently I should trust her word over my own interpretation of Airbnb's T&Cs as she is a lawyer.

According to this ""lawyer"", I will have to either refund the guest or break building regulations and allow her group of 12 to stay tomorrow. Apparently if I refuse to do this they will take legal action against me.

Naturally I have reported the message from the ""lawyer"" to Airbnb and they are now also blocked.

I'm hoping that this is now the end of it, but I would not be surprised if I hear from another one of her friends, they try turning up here tomorrow anyway as Airbnb have e-mailed them the address, or somebody else in her group ends up booking the place.",0.91,34,1554474250.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/b9rtj7/guest_getting_friend_to_harass_me_into_refunding/,True,11

adb02204-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Country Apartment's Sour Dough Bread,"Here is the no-knead sour dough bread recipe that I make for guests. The original recipe calls for the bread to be baked in a cast iron Dutch oven with lid.  I bake it in two  1-1/2 quart square Corning Wear casserole dishes with lids (buy from a thrift store!).  This recipe requires that the bread be baked covered.  I use a KitchenAid stand mixer with the dough hook, so technically you COULD say the bread is kneaded. The dough consistency should be like very thick pancake batter when set to rise.


All measures are approximate.  I use goat milk when available as it makes a crisp crust.  Water makes a chewy crust -- both delicious.  Get your sourdough starter recipe off the internet.  If you start with milk in your starter, you will end up with a very sour starter.   Remember to feed your starter after making each batch.


Bread dough:


5 cups flour

1 T salt

1 to 1 1/2 cups starter

2-3 cups warm water or milk.  Use enough to get the thick pancake batter consistency.

1 teaspoon yeast (if I want to rise and bake on the same day.  Not needed if you plan to let your dough rise over night.) 

Mix everything in the KitchenAid.  Let it knead for 5 minutes or so.


Let the dough rise until doubled -- it will almost be spilling over the top of your large mixer bowl. Grease two casserole dishes and dust with CORNMEAL.  Put the dough in the casseroles and let double again.  Spray lids with non-stick spray.


Heat oven to 450 degrees.  Bake covered for 30 minutes.  Take off cover and bake for another 30 minutes.

One for your next guests, and one for either your family or freeze for future guests.  Much cheaper than bagels!

The last AirBnb I stayed at was good, but the host was rather forward or in my business. When I arrived she showed me around like usual, and handed me a piece of paper with the wifi code. Underneath the code, she had written ""please leave my place a 5 star review on AirBnb."" First of all, I thought that was a little weird by the way it was presented and asking about 5 star reviews only 2 minutes of me arriving.. But nothing crazy.

I'm settling in finally after traveling all day, and she continues to ask me my plans. I mostly just wanted to rest but she insisted on knowing my plans and knowing when I would be back. No worries. I decide to just go into the city for several hours since she insisted I go out and enjoy my night. 

When I arrived that night, she let me in and left a booklet by my door. I opened the booklet and it was empty except for one page that said, again, ""I clean this house twice a week. Please leave a 5 star review. If any issues, just tell me instead."" Second note I received about 5 star reviews. This is only the first night. 

The next day I was pretty wiped out so I decided to lay down for a few hours. I went downstairs for water and she asked when I would be going out. I said probably not because I was tired, and she didn't like that answer. She said it would behoove me to enjoy my time to the fullest. I eventually just said ""yeah maybe I'll go out this evening"" and I went back to the room. I ended up going out.

I came back and everything was fine. The next morning she got mad that I didn't inform her exactly when I was leaving and coming back, saying she didn't hear me come or go and she hates not knowing these details.

This is fine, it's her home, but I find it weird that a grown woman is keeping tabs on another adult and getting hostile when my plans away from the house don't match up with what she expects. I was being very quiet and respectful, completely staying out of her hair. None of this was mentioned on the description that I had to notify her of my plans. 

I have been traveling around throughout the summer so I was only with her for 3 days. Very shortly after, she messages me saying to give her 5 stars. This is the third time she asks for 5 stars. I'm in a foreign country at this point so I couldn't exactly reply to her as I wanted, with limited wifi and being on the go.

Next day, she sends me another message saying that if I have a problem just tell her, and to give her 5 stars. Fourth time now.

Am I being delusional? Am I in the wrong? Yes the accommodation was nice but I didn't care for the host. She wasn't terrible, but being weird about asking for 5 stars that many times by note/message and being very in my business just rubbed me the wrong way.

Lacking options that fit a medium-sized group, I stumbled across the Cherry Lane Mansion on AirBnB, just outside of Saskatoon. The house was more than large enough, had an indoor pool for the kids, great patio space, and was on the river. There was nothing but positive reviews on AirBnB and even Facebook. I messaged the host, Jon, explaining the anniversary party, to which he said he was happy to host and said that my event was “exactly the sort of thing I want to do more of”. I booked it in March, paid the deposit, and all was well. Invitations were sent out to family, decor was bought, food was planned, days were booked off of work, family booked flights to come in from out of the country. 

On July 10, 31 days before the event was supposed to happen, Jon cancelled my booking. He stated that he had “planned another group” to come in. He didn’t have a conversation with me, he didn’t offer a discount on a different day, he simply cancelled for an arbitrary and avoidable reason. And when I sent him a message back explaining how unprofessional this is and how my family has spent immense amounts of time and money getting ready for this, he ignored it. Taking to my local subreddit, I explained my situation and asked the community for recommendations on a new location. A new location was impossible to find- the event date was a month away, in peak wedding season, in Saskatchewan. If you live here, you know we lack options! A couple hours later, I got a message on Reddit from an individual stating that they were poking around online, looking up information on the Cherry Lane Mansion, and found that Jon posts a calendar to the public, on his personal website, with the exact time and dates someone will be arriving, their full name, as well as that individual’s phone number, and AirBnB email address. 

I went to see for myself and sure enough, dozens, if not hundreds of people, have had their personal information posted on his site. I booked **strictly** through AirBnB, and judging by how many people have “AirBnB. com” in their email and have booking codes listed, I’m guessing they booked through the company as well. I agreed for AirBnB and their hosts to see my information within the app, not for all of the internet to see. This is a huge breach of privacy for myself and others. And it doesn’t vanish once you’ve attended the Mansion- you can go back over a year and see who booked the Mansion and when, and get their personal information. 

Upset, I explained the cancellation and the privacy breach to AirBnB immediately. I have gotten nothing but vague replies and “reassurances” from the company that they’ll “look into it”. They have not offered to pay for or discount a different venue (not that I can find any, on Air BnB or elsewhere) and they have not offered any other form of compensation, nor have they enforced any repercussions against Jon that I’m aware of. Only this morning (July 19), almost 10 days after I contacted AirBnB with all of my concerns, the company responded saying they’ve “investigated” the privacy breach, and that there’s nothing they can do since this private information is on a third party website that they don’t have access to. They said they “educated” Jon, and encouraged him to remove the sensitive information, but as of right now, it is still posted for the world to see. There are NO repercussions against Jon from AirBnB for this. In my opinion, they could have banned him from AirBnB for a month or *something* more than just letting their customers information be leaked and posted permanently.

The total for the Cherry Lane Mansion is often over $700 per night- I would have paid $740 for one night. AirBnB’s $50 automatic charge against hosts for cancelling means absolutely nothing to Jon when he’s making hundreds of dollars a night.

So, whether you’re booking a small apartment for Stampede, a big villa in Italy, or having a bachelorette party in Hawaii, your AirBnB host can cancel for any arbitrary reason under the sun, and AirBnB may not assist you in a timely manner, if at all. And if your private information is out on third party sites that you didn’t agree to, AirBnB will be slow to help you. Think twice before booking, y’all.",0.87,34,1563549662.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/cf8ugl/i_had_a_host_frivolously_cancel_on_me_and_post/,True,19

I booked my airbnb over 5 months ago to be across the street from the conference.  I got a confirmation email that the place was ready three days before my arrival.  I  sent a message letting them know my arrival time.  They said my room was no longer available and offered me a room that was more expensive and smaller.  The room I booked had two bedrooms, the one they offered only had one. This was while I was onroute from oregon to Philadelphia,  When I landed I looked at airbnb website and all the listed rooms were 4x higher price than I paid 5 months ago.  Now that I have landed in philly im forced to find a place to stay.  With 20,000 people in town you can guess there are very limited option.   I'm  \^$%#@n   P!$$&).

There is nothing that can convince me that the host discovered she could get much more in rent, then rented it outside of airbnb.  After reviewing the cancellation policy there is no protection for the guest.  I got a refund but now im stuck looking for last minute lodging in a town that is full.  I will end up paying about twice what I booked 5 months ago.  Because of this there is no way I will use airbnb again until they change that.

Edit; Not only was place smaller, it did not have washer and dryer.  I asked for discount and she said no.

adb0400e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Just a reminder to always go with your gut when guests don't feel right,"It's no surprise that AirBnb's new no photo policy is causing a lot of stress on hosts but recently I ran into a real doozie.  
  
Someone booked and has a great story of why they're visiting. She asks in her opening email where she should put her laundry when they check out, etc. and want to leave it in tip top shape. It seemed odd but I guess with no reviews they've been told to stand out when booking for the first time. She's from a town a couple hours away but you know what, I live in a great part of the city and a lot of couples enjoy visiting me. So I accept it... Immediately I regret it when the photo pops up. I don't like to judge a book by it's cover but the photo is very poor quality and questionable.  
  
I do an extensive search on this users name, and finally pull up an old facebook that's barely used. I then do a search of her number and find her advertising listings for ""in-calls"" on an escort website. One of the photos was the same on the facebook to the AirBnb profile so that really helped.  
  
I didn't want to host this person for obvious reasons. Nothing against her field of work, but just not in my home where my family frequents, and my residential building where my neighbors live. It's not something I want to subject myself to. Also I don't appreciate being lied to. This is why there are hotels and motels in my city. They have full time cleaning staff and industrial laundering services... Not a 2.4 cu. ft. and standard household cleaners.
  
Getting the listing taken down took far too long. I didn't want to risk being banned by sending pornographic images to AirBnb through the platform so I had to wait until a manager contacted me through email. Even then I thought I was going to be flagged for going against AirBnb's discrimination policy. Luckilly they have a ""zero tolerance"" policy on prostitution. This is the second escort I've had to kick out in the last two months. I am shocked that AirBnb's security detail was not able to figure this out, and me an average computer user was able to do their job for them... twice. Do they just not care?  
  
And before anyone says ""I don't accept locals anymore"". Every single booking of mine this winter was a local and only 2 were bad, so I'm not really in a place to do this. Also I cancelled penalty-free on 1 guest with bad reviews, and had the other escort kicked out when I found her mini chihuahua and some random in my place when I noticed the number on file was disconnected and once again had to go with my gut. Now I get a prompt even on insta-books, ""even though you have insta book on would you like to accept this person?"". This means when I accept it is no longer an instabook and I can no longer cancel penalty-free if I'm uncomfortable. I have over 80 bookings and have cancelled penalty-free once, and have had two sets of bad guests kicked out and this is how they repay their ""superhosts"".",0.9,32,1553521417.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/b5auus/just_a_reminder_to_always_go_with_your_gut_when/,True,19

adb04b4e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Thank you Redditors!,"I wanted to share a recent hosting incident where advice given on this sub saved the day: 

Our rental is located in a Yosemite National Park gateway city. The recent massive wildfire in Yosemite shut the park down, destroyed local tourism. My guest + family had booked a week stay a couple of months before, and still showed up for his reservation despite the ongoing fire. At that point, the park had just been closed to allow better access for fire fighters, and authorities were still predicting ""Yosemite will be reopened this weekend"", which would have allowed this guest some time in the Park. Unfortunately the fire surged into Park boundaries, ultimately took weeks longer to put out, Yosemite stayed closed. 

Once the continued closure was announced, the guest starts asking for total refund of unused days; our cancellation policy is ""moderate"", so he was entitled to 50% of the remaining stay. He complained about the smoke (which of course was present tho not terrible, more hazy than smoggy, but changed daily), and tried to fear-monger (""fire is getting closer!""), but realistically there was never any real danger - the fire never got closer than 20 miles from us. Was not even in our county, so we never had a declared ""state of emergency"". Here's when I first applied the sub's guidance: we did not agree to refund the entire remainder, citing the terms of our cancellation policy, but we did offer to allow him to ""bank"" all of his unused days and re-book for a future visit (he lives about 5 hours away, and apparently visits the area often). I also told him to file a claim with his vacation cancellation policy (lol). He declined the offer to re-book and ended up leaving about 3 days early. I was never contacted by Airbnb regarding any additional refund beyond the 50% guaranteed by our policy.

Naturally he submits his review a few days later. I assume it will not be good. As is accepted best-practice in this forum when dealing with disgruntled guests, we waited the max period before submitting our review. Ultimately we forgot to write one before the 14 days were up, and the guest's review went live after the deadline. Sure enough, he gave us 2-stars overall, and the review was full of complaints about us as hosts and our place (we are Superhosts with 4.8 average, dings on location naturally :/ ). But there it was, right at the end of his review: ""Airbnb also refused to refund us our money, and wouldn't tell us why"" OMG hallelujah! Thanks to the sub, I knew immediately that his review violated the easiest-to-prove content policy guideline, the one Air actually cares about, and that all I had to do was report it and Airbnb would take it down. Which I did and they did. And since the two-week review period had expired, the guest was not even able to edit and re-post.

I got a booking last week that seemed normal enough. Verified, good reviews, etc.

One day before I get 4-5 messages that only say ""Hey"". Ok, I think no big deal. Then a text that says"" What is your address?"" I remind them to go to their Airbnb account, it will be there.

The morning of check-in I get a bunch more ""Hey"" texts. Then a text asking how many they booked for. Umm, you should know, but I tell them one person. They say it's two now and to call them at a different number than the number they have on Airbnb. I decline and say all communication needs to be through the platform.

So I get this: IM PURE AND DE

At this point, my gut was telling me to nope out of the reservation, even if it means I lose my (useless) Superhost status.

So I call Airbnb, explain the situation, and wait for a callback. 10 minutes later the CS rep calls back, and says he has canceled the reservation after reviewing the communication log. He told me that there were indeed many little things that didn't seem right and I would not be penalized.

I've had a suggestion that I should put little cards in our Airbnb letting guests know how important the ratings are, what they kind of mean, and that we appreciate feedback etc. This was because I mentioned that I don't think most guests know that hosts are delisted for about a 4.3 star average.

My initial reaction is - yuck, begging for reviews.

We don't get bad reviews, mainly five stars. I just had one guy leave 4 for cleaning and didn't give me feedback. I'm scratching my head to work out what was missed and wonder if it was something major or something like dust in the fireplace.

It made me think of how subjective ratings are.

So himself went downstairs to hold their luggage and explain they are 7 hours too early. He gives them a key to come back at 3.

9.00am they return go into our sitting room, switch on the TV and start eating food. Hubby goes back down and tells them they are 6 hours early. Eventually they leave.

The female is about 20 ish and asks for another room as her friend in his 60' s just booked one. We obliged and advised they needed to pay extra. She said that was ok. About 11.00pm they return home both drunk, her top is open and she makes her way upstairs.

They stayed in all day and he keeps going out to the shop and returning with food bags and goes up to the double room. He must have left about 10 times while we were home. She came out of the room once and my 10 yr said why is that womans bum not covered. Had to explain she was probably too warm.

 They have a large bathroom but one of them left poo on the seat which am not cleaning so caught her trying to use the family one. She just smiled and said sorry. I just said no problem you obviously missed the massive private sign on the door. So the poo is still on the seat. 

They are here for 8 days, they are  just friends, he booked the holiday and was probably hoping that if in one room , a relationship will develop. But he is in her room all the time except for sleep.

Is This A Cause For A 4 Star Review?,"So I'm kind of new to this whole AirBNB thing but I've tried to set up myself to where I'll be getting locations that fit my preferences. Which honestly, isnt all that high maintenance, I just want the location to be quiet, clean, and have wifi. You fit those 3 criteria and it's an easy 5 star from me. I mention as such in my bio and I usually mention my preference for quiet environments in the first message I make to future hosts.

As such, unless I am willing to take a calculated risk, I try to avoid locations that say they have young kids or babies. Call me an unpleasant person however you want, but the fact is that I find really young children intolerable. I'm not a fan of kids running up and down the hall or babies crying me awake in the morning. So for the good of everyone involved, I try to stick with already well established households with the filters of Superhosts and Entire Place To Yourself filters turned on. And even then, I comb the reviews and read line after line to make sure I'm not missing any details that may affect my stay.

Well this location I'm in currently has kids that was nowhere to be found in their description or reviews. It's a nice basement flat but I can clearly hear everything that is going on up above me. I've woken up to babies crying for 2 days now and its irksome. 

Shouldn't the presence of children have been disclosed, or at least alluded to? Noise is a huge factor in my enjoyment of a stay so I generally try to do my due diligence before deciding on a location. Would I be in the right taking off a star for this? 

I am not ignorant to how reviews affect AirBNB businesses and I am sure they use the income to support their family. Everyone else has given them 5 star reviews so I really don't want to be that guy that harms their stability. At the same time however, Airbnb is a service and I truly believe they should have put in some sort of warning about noise if not children.

Apologies if this seems pretty clear cut to some, but believe it or not I'm not in the business of making people lives worse off when I leave. I don't like leaving bad reviews in general so I usually take more consideration when making them than I do when leaving good reviews. I just wanted to run this by the community here before I do leave a 4 star as to make sure I'm not missing an angle I haven't considered.

EDIT: I reviewed the listing again and it does indeed say there are children. I don't know how I missed that vital piece of info but regardless I did miss it, so that is on me. The score won't lower when I leave.

* I expect a picture of the guest to reflect him (he had a picture of a pig). 
* I expect the guest to be verified by government ID (I know airbnb has a sketchy reputation even with that). 
* I ask guests to give me some details as to why they want to stay with me (I don't want wedding guests and heavy drinking and our place is near a popular club) and state that I decline guests who plan to heavily drink even if off the premises. I also ask them for an approximate arrival time. He responded to none of these questions. 

Due to Airbnb's new >= 88% approval rule I decided not to instantly decline the guest but instead call customer support to cancel this without penalty due to breaking house rules. I respond to the guest in a way that it is clear I do not plan to host them but don't decline. 

5 hours later I'm on my way home when the guest messages me that he is 'outside' my home asking which house it is. He is not - and I'd feel sorry for them because my home is nearly an hour by bus out of town, but still it was his tactics to try and get the booking approved. 

I call Airbnb, they cancel immediately after first telling me I should not tell the guest that I will decline, because they would usually rate this as declining and it would affect my quota. In this instance they will make an exception.

I ultimately left my event a bit earlier than I would have otherwise, and I found the experience fairly awkward.

I had an inquiry come in today from an 'influencer' who wanted me to give her my cabin for a week for free ($2000 USD) at peak season in exchange for social media posts and high-res photos taken for promotional use (I already have professionally taken photos for my listing).

I declined because I'm already compelled to pay a monthly tourism fee to the resort's municipality, my first season was **completely** booked and let's be candid, she only has 9k Instagram followers and averages 200 likes a post; for comparative context, my colleague's wiener dog has 35k followers without artificial boosting.

adb07448-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Feeling a bit conned by a guest,"I thought I share a guest experience we have at the moment as a host. 

We rent out 2 unused bedrooms to up to 4 guests and a bathroom dedicated to those two rooms in our home in the UK. We allow our guests shared access to the kitchen, dining room, garden etc. 

I have a clear statement in our booking that when 2 guests require both rooms, we kindly ask to book for 3 guests which incurs a small surcharge to make up for the cleaning costs etc. I did discuss this with the Airbnb support and they said this is acceptable, in over a year, this has never been an issue. 

We have (clearly stated in our listing) a dog and cat and request that guests only book if they are fine with animals. I work from home and most of the time the dog is in my room but when I am on calls I need the dog to be in the shared areas. 

Our listing states that light use of the kitchen is fine, but that we prefer if guests can notify us if they plan any big meals so that we can plan timings with/around them. We also clearly state that we do not approve of people outwith the actual paying guests being on our premises. 

--

I received a same day booking some 3 days ago, 8 nights for two. Habitually I responded, pointing out the 2 room policy offering them to take a pick of the room they prefer or notifying them of the rate for 2 rooms which is no more than a 25% surcharge on the 2 guest rate. Given it's a say day rating and I'm not at home I also point out that I won't be able to accept guests before 8pm. Almost immediately I get a call back from the so far unrated guest, being very unfriendly about the 2 room surcharge but agreeing to it. 

He arrives the same day at about 9pm, complaining about the long wait (as if it's my fault he is an extra hour late/only booked around noon that day) I almost always arrange to be at home at the time guests arrive if I know in advance and I have no issues even if guests check in early morning or check out in the evening. 

Then looking at our dog - which sits quietly, not barking not making any noise (it's been a lot of work to get him to that point but he is when we want really quiet and just approaches guests, never barking, but hoping for cuddles) and just says: ""He cannot be near my mother"". 

Minutes later the gentleman appears through the door with a wheelchair. next to him an elderly Italian lady come into the room. I explain to him the locking mechanism to our front door - something guests have not managed to do correctly so quite important to me and give him keys before kindly asking him if he minds taking the shoes off so I can show him the room or if he would like to get his luggage in first. 

He ignores me and asks ""Where is the kitchen?"" I show him and he immediately follows me in his street shoes and points out to me that the space in the cupboards we provide is insufficient (It has never been even for families of 4 when we had one less cupboard shelf available for Airbnb guests) Our dog still follow us quietly and as he leaves the kitchen he points out to me that the dog 'has to go"". 

I bring he dog into my study and show him the rooms, he follows me all the way up the steep stairs (our listing does mention that the rooms are all one floor up) approving them but complaining that there is just one bathmat in the bathroom. (it's one and a pretty high quality one at that)

He looks into the rooms, seems to find them okay and then points at the stairs. ""Can you take that chair and place it on the top of the stairs? I don't want my mum to fall down the stairs by accident. The light in the hallway has to always be on at night, so she can see."" (Our listing does state that we do not provide any gates on the stairs for infants and that indeed the property may not be suitable for infants)

I'm contemplating how I'll discuss this setup as we walk down the stairs. As I arrive on the ground floor the older lady (who I presumed to be this gentleman's mother) comes through the main door with an even older lady. The man happily announces that this 92 year old lady is indeed his mother and the the other person is her carer who will be staying with us. With those words he pretty much leaves and needs me to explain everything I've just said to him in English to the carer who speaks not a single word of English via Google Translate. 

In 2 days he has not show up again other than to pick his mother up for a half hour walk whilst I was on a work call. 

I have to keep my dog permanently out of the shared rooms. In the middle of the night our bedroom door suddenly opened when the mother - clearly affected by dementia - did not remember which room was her bedroom. Every time the carer leaves our house, the front door remains not just unlocked but adjar as the son clearly did not explain to the carer how to lock it and my attempts to do so in English are not helping. 

Yesterday again when I was on a fairly important client call, three cars suddenly drove up into our driveway (our listing clearly states that there is only space for one car and that we cannot accommodate more as our neighbours run a business and any additional car will limit the access to their car park area.) As I later learned the son, his sister, the grandchild, the grandchild husband and 3 grandchildren all came to visit Nonna. Having already accepted that I keep our dog in my room, this number of guests is clearly not leaving my dog - who cannot see what happens outside the room quiet, I have to mute my work obligations and sort out the dog. Before my call is over the whole family, except for the carer and the mother have disappeared again after checking out all the rooms - including those that we don't share like our bedroom. 

-- 

I'm not sure how to pick this up. I don't want to distress the elderly and clearly dement lady. The carer has been nothing but polite. But the failings by the son to me are huge. Our property is not suitable for infants and I'd say this implies the same for elderly ladies who suffer from dementia and may fall down the stairs/only leave the house in a wheelchair. I cannot leave the house if the tenants don't know how to lock my front door. 

I don't even want to think about the potential insurance implications if something like a fall happens on the stairs or due coming out of my room when Im not totally alert. 

I'm literally considering all options from Airbnb support to calling the police, but just don't want to mess things up for that elderly lady. 

**Update**

5th day (Saturday) and the son or rest of the family still have not shown.

I've contacted Airbnb Support who have been great and they: 

* Will by email clarify the legal situation, cover if eg. the Nonna happens to fall down the stairs, etc also considering this is a 3rd party booking and technically the T&C's may apply different to a third party - though this would after all be a party that the Airbnb tenant has let into our property. 
* Confirmed that I could technically refuse this booking as third party booking and that I could do so even now on the grounds that it would have not been sensible to kick this lady out upon arrival. Again, I do not intend to do this but I'm glad people here pointed it out. 
* I also made it clear that my review of this person will simply state that it was an unacceptable 3rd party booking, that I'll further confront the son about the situation and my expectations should the family show up again and they confirmed that given it was a 3rd party booking, I should have no issues getting any negative reviews from the tenant removed. This is not so much about this one rating but the fact that it could have an impact on our Superhost status. 

**Update II**

These guests have now left. Clearly it's not been an easy week, but weighing the positives and the negatives, the elderly lady and her carer were very polite as far as that is possible under the circumstances of having to use Translate over the phone to communicate. 

I think what got to me is that someone had the audacity to just put up his mum here, not visit - other then drop off food once in a while and otherwise pretty much ignore her. Also clearly from personal experience with my own elderly family members, there was the concern about accidents, causing accidental damage etc. However, all of this was not an issue and these guests left the place incredibly clean and tidy. 

I have both left a private message to the booking son as well as to Airbnb, raising the issues and that it was not a third party booking with a fair bit of lacking information and given the circumstances the last minute nature of the booking was concerning - though I could just as well imagine that this may have been caused by someone not being as kind and asking this person to leave. 

I have finally updated our listing a little bit to cover for the property being unsuitable for people with mobility issues of any kind due to our dog and the stairs on the way do the bedroom.

adb0788a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Creepiest Airbnb guest/host?,"Curious to hear everyone's stories of their creepiest guest (or creepiest host).

Here's mine:

A dude booked one of my Airbnb rooms, which was located next to my own in the house. When he arrived, I gave him the tour, showing him the guest bathroom which is by the front entrance, and left him to it.

The morning after his first night I was sitting on my back patio eating breakfast, and was approached by both him and two other guests staying at the house. We all had a short friendly chat about plans for the day, with me giving suggestions for things to do.

Everyone went their way, and as I had had a crappy nights sleep, I went back to bed to try and nap. My room has an ensuite when you first come in the door, and is a long room with a sliding door to the patio on its far end. My bed faces the patio door.

Some time later, I'm awoken by a figure standing in front of my sliding door, whose curtains are open so I can see my trees, with the screen door closed. It's the guest. He sees me in my bed, and starts talking to me, asking me questions about places to eat etc. I was so discombobulated at 1) being woken from my nap and 2) having a strange man trying to converse with me while I am horizontal under my covers in my bed. He eventually leaves and I fight off a case of the willies.

He stays one more night then is off. 

When his review comes in, he mentions in the review that 'the bathroom is located in the hosts bedroom, which is a little awkward.' 

I realize he has been entering my room as I sleep in the night and morning to use MY ensuite, not using the guest bathroom (that is so huge and prominent that it's quite ridiculous he would forget it was his). 

I still get the heebeejeebies when I think of him standing at my door talking to me in my bed.",0.92,32,1504200973.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/6x8d80/creepiest_airbnb_guesthost/,True,16

adb07b5a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,UPDATE: Guest asking me to pick-up from airport at 11pm. What would you do? ( correct answer: RUN),"You guys who said not to accept him based on his request alone - you ended up being right.  I needed the money, though, so I had taken a chance and accepted him. I let him know, apologetically, that I would be unable to pick him up from the airport, but I would be fine with the late check-in and would still host him otherwise, and to please keep me posted once his plane landed and he was en route so I could meet him outside in my bright green ""host hoodie"" and save him the trouble of trying to find a new place in middle of the night. I offer late check-in, so I have a very effective system with this green hoodie for making midnight check-ins easy on the guest.

This was my first uncomfortable host experience. Admittedly, the guest was clean, quiet, did not steal anything, and did no damage to my home. in that technical sense, he was a perfect guest However, the guest: 

- provided a phone number that was not his, but that of a friend (fraud)

- does not have a phone at all (who travels in the US using the airbnb platform and doesn't have a phone?! this guy was here for a meeting with GOOGLE FFS).

- the phone belongs to a ""friend"" of his, who then asked for my address, that the friend assures me he will send to the guest (nooooooope)

- did not message me letting me know his plane had landed and he was on his way

- knocked on neighbors doors at 1am trying to find me (because this dipshit doesn't have a phone). Neighbors were asleep, and pissed, and not happy. NOT COOL. 

BUT...He was already here, and he had a 2-day stay only, so I collect this moron and bring him inside. The guest then:

- Comments that I am ""cute"" (which, while I acknowledge is a complement, made me very uncomfortable - a man probably should refrain from such complements to a female he doesn't know just after she let him into her home at 1am.)

- Guest asks for a wake up knock so he won't miss his Google meeting. Needs me to wake him up at 6:30am. Fine. Whatever.

- I'm getting ready to leave, and guest asks for a ride to Google for his big important meeting. He has done nothing to facilitate his travel. I inform guest that Google is not in the direction I am going, and that I do not have time to give him a ride, and that he should arrange for a cab. Guest then asks for me to please call him a cab (because again, no phone, and apparently unable to navigate the request online) so he can get to google. I am a 15 minute walk from the campus, but fine, whatever. I call this yokel a cab. He is visibly uneasy with the cab saying it will take 10 minutes to get to me, saying he needs to be at Google ASAP. I can't control that he didn't do ANYTHING to get himself to google sooner, but I apologize for this spot and say ""we can try to call much earlier when you will need a cab next time, that way we can be sure they are here in time.

- End of day 1, guest says he was frustrated that after his meeting Google didn't offer any rides home or offer an easy way to arrange a cab for him to get home. I don't understand for the life of me why this person thinks everyone else in the world is supposed to support his travel itinerary.

- Guest says he has a day for traveling for fun, and wants me to give him ideas on what to do. I give him some suggestions, but he is not impressed, and is basically saying ""i'll do some research on what I want to do, but you'll help me figure out the travel logistics, right?"" I live down in Silicon Valley, dude wants to know how much time and money various San Francisco and north bay touring options cost. I have no clue, and i'm not a 24 hour concierge service. I'm less than half the cost of a crappy hotel here, and this guy is acting like i'm supposed to be the Bellagio in terms of customer service.
 
- Guest seems frustrated by end of day 2 (or maybe tired, this guy was tough to read!), and asks for a wake up call and a cab to be arranged for the morning of day 2. I oblige to get this over with ASAP. Guest says he wants to leave for airport at 8:30. I make the arrangements the night before so we don't have a repeat of the whole ""what if as soon as they can is too late!?!?!"" nonsense.

- At 8:10am, guest is suddenly worried about traffic and congestion at the airport and asks to move up the cab to 8:15. I have to explain that I will call but it is likely too late. 

He's gone now. Holy. Shit. Lesson learned.  I have no problem reporting him to airbnb for the fraudulent phone number. How bad should I make the review? like I said, he was clean, quiet, and physically respectful of my space. He just had an unrealistic expectation for the amount of support he thought a host would be providing, logistically speaking.

What reference to leave?","Yesterday a guest (women) arrived to my door with two 23kg. bags. I specified in the listing that it was a 4th floor with no elevator.... still, she made a surprised face and asked me for help. Ok, I helped her get her bags up, proceeded with the same routine, left her the keys and continued with my life. 

Today she told be that she will leave at 3AM in the morning, and if I could take her bags out at 12aM so she could just call her Uber to pick them up from there to the car. I told her that it wasn't safe to do that, and that she could leave them at the door and ill take them down the latest I can (I go to sleep at around 2AM usually, so at that time I really doubted someone would steal her luggage... The thing is that she didn't left anything and I went happy to sleep.

Then it got to me, that she personally will not be able to take those bags down, they were almost her size, and that if in the process of taking them down alone at 3AM they fall, she will a 100% put that on me and leave me a bad reference for not ""helping"" her. 

So I stood up till 3AM to help her... and well, she woke up almost at 4AM, just told me she was in a hurry and that if I could help her with the bags..

I was really annoyed by then, so I just took them to the door, and went down the stairs with one, expecting she will follow me with the other one, and I'll just help her midways to take that one down too. She didn't moved, when I was back at the apartment she just passed me by with her backpackS.... I had to take down the second bag (which I believe was a couple kg heavier than the 23kg norm), then handed it to the uber guy , she just said a fast thanks and left.

I'm really dissatisfied with this situation.  I just rent a room, I can help a little with the luggage, but being the official carrier of her 50kg of I don't know what, and have her there not even trying to help just pissed me off. 

It really feels like she abused of my hospitality, and knew very well where she was getting into, and was expecting me to take care of her luggage.  Me and her Ubers...

adb0829e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Got my neighbor's illegal Airbnb shut down.,"TL/DR - My neighbor got a permit for owner/occupied.  He has never lived there.  I haven’t met him in the 8+ or so months that he has owned it.  We filed a codes complaint against him for improper permit.  He didn’t show in court.  He didn’t appeal in time.  Stop work order was placed on his front door and the listing was removed from a short term rental site.

Edit - [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/rHG20Jv) is a map view of the Airbnb including all the people who dealt with his disruptive parties and problem.  

So, long story.

I read that nothing shuts down a short term rental like neighbors with pitchforks.  Agreed.

My neighbor sold his house last year.  The day it closed, I expected to see the new folks.  Nothing.  Nothing for about four weeks.  No lights, no cars.  I work, but my wife never saw anything either.  Neither did my other neighbors.  Strange.  

I get a letter in saying that the new neighbor had applied for a short term rental permit as an owner/occupied.  Seeing that my family and I stay in them, I didn’t see a huge issue since he would be living there.  However, I would later discover he never moved it and probably never slept a night there.

I kept waiting to meet the guy. They came in and painted, put a hot-tub in the back, fire-pit out there, chairs for ten people and decked the house out to sleep 12-14 adults.  Being that I live in a party town, I knew that people who were going to stay there were coming to party and party they did. It was an instant booking.

Again, the guy never lived there.  Despite what he said about it to everyone else, he didn’t live there.  Through my neighbor’s Ring, we were able to document months of comings and goings.  Never once was it the owner.  We know this because we captured video evidence when they were out there with the designers.  We knew their vehicles and what they looked like.  My neighbor met them and knew what they and their cars looked like.

It was a nuisance on almost every weekend.  People getting out of Ubers at 1:30 in the morning drunk while screaming “(Insert city name) Rocks!”  They’d throw their beer bottles in the yard.  They had drunken cornhole tournaments late into the night while screaming vulgar words.  They’d do this during the day too.  I couldn’t play in the yard with my own small children due to what they were yelling that they were going to do with the women that they’d pick up downtown.

I don’t mind my neighbor having an occasional party or loud get together.  But imagine a loud get together every single Thursday, Friday and Saturday night.  Every.  Single.  Weekend.  I started keeping track of all of the issues.  We had about twelve that I wrote down in just three months.  That didn’t include the loud get togethers with music that I just zoned out.

The cleaning crew would come out on Saturday morning and take the trash and recycling bins out front.  The problem is that trash isn’t picked up until Friday.  The recycling containers aren’t picked up until the first Friday of each month.  However, they’d leave the containers out there for 10 or more days at a time; this happened all the freaking time.

My wife would shield my young children from seeing giant penis balloons that were placed on the front porch while the cleaning crew took care of the house after bachelorette parties (rental description said “No parties”).  Beer cans would overflow over the trashcans on a weekly basis (again, out there far too early for pickup).

The wind would blow them over and I’d have to clean it up. Why?  Because the owner didn’t live there and never saw it.  Yeah, I could have called him, but if he lived there, he would have seen that crap and cleaned up.  He wouldn’t have put that out six days early and leave it up there five days after pickup. 

There are giant weeds that an owner wouldn’t allow to stay there.  There was a lawn care service, but they just mowed the lawn.  They didn’t tidy up the bushes or anything.

My neighbors and I got the owner’s number via the permit and texted him.  He wouldn’t respond.  He would just forward the texts to the property manager.  We later found out that they would charge the tenants the deposit for the disruption. Therefore, we dealt with a disruption and the owner made more money.  I think the manager didn’t relay the issues we were having.  That was a mistake in going through him.

They’d leave the house at 9:00 on a Friday and then leave all the lights on and the front door propped.  They’d head download and then get back home around 1:00 in the morning, or later.  Drunks aren’t quiet when they get out of taxis and neither are individuals who enjoy the bar life, which we have plenty of in our town.

We also contact the manager (again foolish to do that, should have called the owner) during one of the loudest parties. Oh they have noise monitors.  Well, they ain’t working!  The manager said he’d talk to them.  Would they quiet down?  Kind of.  If you consider turning down their music from volume 10 to about volume 8.  This was during an apparent cornhole world championship.  After my neighbor had complained over and over about it, the manager basically said, “Hey, it’s 3:00 on a Saturday.  There isn’t noise ordinance during the day.”  Basically, deal with it.  

My other neighbor saw them urinate off the front porch.  Nice. 

After dealing with this for about a month and a half, my neighbor went down to codes.  Yes, he had a legal permit, but that didn’t mean it was legit.  It said that it was owner-occupied.  We informed codes about the situation and they pushed it to metro legal.  The court date was set and we had our documentation.  Video evidence, pictures of all of the trash, etc.

He didn’t show.  He had emailed for a continuance based on a divorce.  We found out that his divorce hearing wasn’t until the next day.  He had lied.  He could have made it.  The judge asked my neighbor and I when we could come back. It was scheduled for one week from that day.  

We showed back up.  Nervous.  I had never been to court.  I was looking forward to finding out what he looked like.  I had questions prepared to show the judge that he didn’t live there.  What time does our mail run?  What day is our trash day?  What about recycling?  What kind of unusual car does one of your neighbors have?  Any person living here for two months knows the answers to those questions and he had “lived” there for over eight months.

He didn’t show.  He defaulted and we were told that he’d have five days to appeal after the paperwork was processed.  We had to wait about two weeks until it was processed and then he had five days to appeal.  Lucky for us, the owner thought the $50 fine and court costs were all he’d have to face.  He had no idea that once you are served papers, finding out all the other info from the courts is up to you.  They (gov’t) have done their job once those papers are dealt.  The date came and his permit was cancelled.  He didn’t appeal.  

While waiting for the initial appeal to happen, I had had it!  That was the weekend of the cornhold championship.  It was a beautiful day and I was forced to either stay inside or leave my own home.  I looked up the permit and called the number listed.  The guy had no idea who I was.  I then erupted.  He was adamant that he lived there.  He was cordial, but caught flat-footed.   It was beyond obvious that he didn’t live there.  He called another neighbor a he, when it was only a single female who lived there.  I honestly think that he had no idea about the issues.  Looking back, the property manager probably didn’t tell him about any of the issues.

The property manager was either in collusion (fun word in 2019) with the owner or really believed that he lived there.  He manages at least 20 other properties.  Many of them are full houses, instant bookings and designed to house about 10-14 adults.  All with hot-tubs and parties ready to happen, (despite the descriptions saying “no parties”).  

Two days after the date to appeal passed, a Stop Work Order was posted.  It was joyous. The manager pleaded with us for patience and the owner said he had been working on some things to not cause disruptions.  We had been patient enough.

First, why didn’t he stop by the very first day he bought it and introduce himself, give us his cell and tell us what he was doing?  Why didn’t the property manager stop by and introduce himself and give us his contact info?  Why did we put up with this irritation and then he make more money when we complained?  Why, after I called the guy and told the owner all the issues were were having, didn’t he knock on my door and talk to me?  They failed on so many levels.

This is the reason why neighbors should be required to sign-off on permits in order for owner-occupied to continue.  Issue a temporary one and then the neighbors have to sign off every three months or so.  Then, the owner would make sure that they do it right.  They would stop parties and make sure they weren’t disrupting the communities.  I didn’t move next to this and then start complaining.  They moved next to me and started this crap.

Now, I wait to find out if he puts it up for rent or sells it.

I was actually staying at an Airbnb overnight to attend an event near me and got an alert saying my reservation was cancelled at 2:00 in the morning. Of course I didn't wake up for this. 

I tried to log into airbnb in the morning and couldn't, but chalked it up to being on my phone and not having my password saved. Then I tried to buy a coffee and my card was denied. I use Revolut so immediately checked the account and saw that my balance was at basically zero. I checked my email and saw the booking confirmations and then account cancellation. The hackers just completely cancelled my account once they were finished. 

I called Airbnb and am waiting to hear from the Trust and Security (I think that's the name?) team, but was assured it was a top priority as the charges were still pending. It was a significant amount of money, so I'm truly hoping they're able to do something, thus avoiding the chargeback process. We'll see. 

I would suggest not saving any cards to the account and regular password updates of course. I have zero idea how they gained access to my account. It really doesn't make sense.

We are new to hosting, but we have been AirBnB guests several times. We had our first guest book for 33 days, and he’s been with us for 3 weeks now. The first week was fine, didn’t have any problems at all, he seemed decent. But after that first week, we noticed some trends. He would use our pots/pans to cook, which was totally fine, but he wouldn’t clean them. He even put a pot with food still in it, in the refrigerator. He also started taking 45-60 minute showers every morning, and also in the afternoon. I understand that some people have different ideas of hygiene, but we also need hot water. For whatever reason, I expected guests to treat their stay as they would at a hotel or anywhere that shouldn’t be totally trashed, but I guess that’s not a standard for everyone. We’ve repeatedly talked to him about the dishes, which he still won’t clean. What else can we do? We are trying to be understanding, but we feel that he is being disrespectful of our hospitality. We are open to any and all suggestions.

Update: somehow we managed having him here until the agreed-upon date, and he was supposed to check-out over an hour ago. His belongings are still in my house, and he locked the bedroom door while he’s gone to work. I called AirBnB, and they’re assisting me with what to do.

adb08f5a-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Bad air as an extenuating circumstance? Full refund for guest 2 days before arrival,"Guest messaged me saying they wanted to host a BBQ with family members in our backyard. Max 8 people. Asked for a discount promising to be clean, etc. It's a huge house and they only booked it for 2 nights (so that they have 1 full day) and I was reluctant but ended up giving them a great deal. 

Turns out, we have this thing called rain around here from time to time. 2 days before arrival he messages me asking to cancel due to the weather. I said that he would be welcome to cancel but that I could not refund anything given the short notice. No response after that and a few hours later he cancels. 

When I check my emails later that day, I see a message from Airbnb informing me that they had processed a full refund for this guest due to extenuating circumstances. I immediately messaged them, asking what circumstances they were considering extenuating and was informed that it was due to the bad air and that the guest was concerned about air quality in our area. This is of course ridiculous as he lives here and the upcoming rain would definitely clean the air very nicely. I questioned the support rep on the logic of this concession and he escalated the ticket to his supervisor. 

Supervisor explains that they consider air with an air quality index (AQI) of 151 or worse to be an extenuating circumstance, that the refund had already been made and that I should respect their decision on the matter. 

I did some research and it turns out that an AQI over 151 is actually pretty common in many cities across Europe. It is NORMAL in India or China to have AQI of 200+ and 151+happens frequently in many parts of the US, as well. What's worse, AQI in my city was only 20 on the day of arrival thanks to the rains...

I responded to the ticket with screenshots of AQI around the world and an AQI of 25 in our city. I asked if anybody in Europe  could just cite the same policy to get out of their reservation free of charge. I also pointed out that the guest actually lived locally and that he had previously asked to cancel due to the rains... The agent, however, never responded and just closed the ticket. I then called the Airbnb Superhost line and explained why I was frustrated to which I got a very empathetic ""we understand but there is nothing we can do"". When I asked what ""proof"" the guest submitted to substantiate his claim of this being an extenuating circumstance the rep told me that this was highly confidential and that there really was nothing she could do besides raise the fact that the agent I messaged with shouldn't have just closed my ticket without ever answering me. I knew she was just following protocol and didn't want to be the asshole, so I just thanked her for explaining it to me and said goodbye....

Is there anything I can do here or is this a lost cause? I'm really super disillusioned by how unfairly Airbnb decided in the guest's favor here, without considering that hosts depend on this income and have costs associated with getting a big house like this ready for a group of 8.

adb09392-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Block Party, Lies, and the Perfect Storm","So I’m out of town for Thanksgiving, which is a very rare for me. I get a message from Lying Guest (LG) at 4pm (Check in is 4pm) saying this, “Hello, I have been working all week and I’m just looking for a nice place to relax and chill for a couple of days”. I had another guest just leave and my wife’s aunt had already cleaned the place so everything was good to go. The booking was for the LG and 2 additional guest. So I accepted and sent over the check in instructions. 

I get a call from my neighbor saying I need to check on the property ASAP. She says there is a huge party going on and although people (and myself) have had parties there before my neighbors have never complained. I check my Ring Doorbell and there are 8 young adults (3 shirtless) standing by my front door and a table set up (found out later from another video that they were charging entry at the table). 

I call the LG who says he is not having a party but is just having a small family gathering. I told him he is not having a small family gathering he is having a party and he needs to get everyone out right now. My neighbor then calls me and tells me someone just through another person over the fence (3 foot fence) into her yard and there is a fight going on. 

Neighbor and me call the cops which takes over an hour to show up. By this time it’s a complete nightmare in which my neighbors are all sending me videos and pictures. The police told me that the guest have a right to be there and they can not evict or ask them to leave. However because of the noise and neighbors and the fights they are shutting down the party and they estimated they kicked out 100 people from the area. 

The LG calls me and told me that he shit everything down and it’s just him and 4 guest. I look on my Ring Doorbell and there are 6 people in just the front of my house. I told him I want him and his guest gone in which he tells me that he has no where else to go and he shut everything down. He begs for me to let him to stay and he said he paid and he talked to the neighbors and everything is okay. I tell him no and I’m on my way there in which he tells me not to come and everything is over and they are going to chill and go to sleep. 

More people start showing back up and there is another fight in my front yard. The neighbors call the police again and this time they yell at the police that someone is getting their ass kicked and to not take an hour. 

Police finally kick out everyone after my friend shows up begging and me begging for them to do something. The police say it’s all my fault, I should be in town, I shouldn’t have give them permission to come onto the property. They say that the guest has a contract (in which AIRBNB voided) and it’s a civil matter and they can’t evict anyone. 

I tell the LG that I will refund them their money and please just leave. Everyone finally is gone and my friend locked down the house. I was on the phone with the LG, neighbors, friend, police, and Airbnb from 11pm till 2:30am. 

LG calls me the next day saying he never had a party and he wants his money back and to come back and look for his lost wallet. My other friend meets him today to let him look and when my friends points out the broken fence, blinds, sticky floors, broken chairs, bloody shirt, and everything else he claims that all that was broken upon his arrival. 

I understand having a party and getting wild because I was a dumb young kid too but I don’t understand the lying. I told him I have pictures of everything before the party and nothing was damaged before. He told me he took pictures too of everything and he has proof that all that stuff was broken upon his arrival. He continues to lie about everything even though I have Ring Doorbell video and my neighbors cameras and pictures from the other neighbors. I hate him. I hate his lying. I hate my vacation too. 

Will I get anything from AIRBNB? Will I get reimbursed through my claim at AirBNB? AirBNB did send me the payment for his two night stay already but that doesn’t cover even half of the damages.

adb094fa-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Charge for Luggage Storage - Update!,"Hey everyone, a few months ago I posted this [on an idea I was tossing around to charge for early luggage dropoff or holding beyond checkout time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/93x1wf/charge_for_luggage_storage/?st=JNSCJLDE&sh=ed5e0b3d).

After some internal tug of war and weighing responses I decided to give it a go. I added the details of it to my listing and included the information in a new ‘FAQ’ message I created that I now send guests when they book. 

I charge a flat rate per booking, per day - so a couple with 4 pieces of luggage pays $10 same as one dude with a backpack. I figured it’s just easier and represents the work I’m doing to engage with them rather than space it takes up in the house. I do all the payments through Airbnb as a request for fees.

So far it’s been INCREDIBLY HELPFUL. This is after about two months of having it going on.

My requests for early luggage dropoff have SIGNIFICANTLY dropped off (which is fine for me) and those who do want it have usually read the info and state they’re happy to pay for the convenience. Haven’t had any problems with payments going through on Airbnb. 

I’ve had several who don’t read things ask to drop off early, so I respond with a reference to the info and state I’m happy to do so for the fee, at which point they suddenly decide it’s not worth it to them. Frankly - YAY!!! I feel like this has successfully shifted the burden and made it so people consider more the benefits vs inconvenience.

And I’m no longer grumpy interrupting my cleaning routine to say hello and welcome their bags into the house. Win win!

Thought I’d share an update since we don’t always get to hear what happens after the fact, with many posts.

7:00. I call AirBNB and explain at least 2 ToS violations by the guest and tell them that I want the request retracted. They say they are going to call the guest.

Check in was at 3 pm on Friday. We did not hear anything from them until 10 pm that night. The guest states that her allergies are flaring up because of our dog. I stated in the listing we have a dog on the premises but he will not be there during the stay. Everything was swept, mopped, dusted and vacuumed the morning of arrival. I immediately respond and ask what I can do to make the situation better for her? We would have sent over cleaners, as we are out of town. I also said if fresh air would help she was welcome to open our large window in the living room. I did not hear anything back from her. I figured everything was fine after this.

The second day Saturday she doesn't respond to my question but says they are still having a hard time with the allergies, but they will stay Saturday night as well.

Sunday after check out she presents a whole list of issues including how she felt the bath tub wasn't cleaned properly, how we need to replace all of our carpets, how she wasn't sure if our electric was up to code? Not sure where that came from.

She checked out, left me a bad review which I was expecting and thought she was just difficult to please. 

Now tonight on Monday, I receive a message from airbnb that she is requesting a one night refund. She submitted pictures of the carpets which still look freshly vacuumed, albeit not brand new because you know we do live here full time. She submitted a picture of about five stray dog hairs I missed under the shower curtain.

I explain my side to airbnb and they are saying she should receive the one night refund.

Am I being crazy here? When she decided to stay the second night and did not respond to attempts for resolution, it was hard for me to resolve.

It seems if she felt it was that unclean she would have checked out the first night which in that case of course she would get the refund. 

But it seems the plan was to stay the entire booking with plans to get half of it refunded anyway.

This is my 4th trip using AirBnB. My experience with the platform has been great so far until this trip. I wanted to share my experience and ask if this is a normal AirBnB experience since I'm so new to the platform; maybe my expectation is too high.

I've just checked into this place today, somewhere in Europe. The host is an English-speaking single male, a Superhost with 5/5 rating and over 100 good reviews from America and European countries. I guess with that, I expected at least somewhat professional level of hosting. However my experience hasn't been so smooth:

1. I told him my arrival time, and he didn't give me any instruction in finding my way to the address or getting into the accommodation. When I arrived precisely at the arrival time he was nowhere to be found, and he did not answer my AirBnB messages. I had to find a phone to call him to come down.

2. The booking was for a ""private room"". On arrival I found it's a studio house, and he lives and sleeps in the living room. Whenever I want to go in or out of the house, use the kitchen or the bathroom I would have to walk past his living space. This wasn't mentioned anywhere in the listing.

3. Finally - When I went to use the bathroom just now, I could hear furious banging in the kitchen and a girl moaning. For a moment I thought it was a neighbor and the place had thin walls, but then I heard the voice moaning the AirBnB host's name which was a nail in the coffin. It made me extremely uncomfortable - Social reasons (I'm raised in a conservative culture) and also I don't feel welcome using public spaces that I should be able to freely use (Kitchen, bathroom, etc)

My stay is getting a bit uncomfortable, but I'm confused whether I'm the demanding jerk here since he has maintained a Superhost status with other guests having a good trip. Maybe it's ok to host to have some fun in the kitchen; I'm not sure what standards to rely on.

I took all of your comments on board and it was super helpful to have an open mind about hearing all your thoughts on reviewing this guest before submitting the review.  In the end I gave 5 stars for house rules and communication, 4 stars for cleanliness, and in my public review wrote something along the lines of ""Hosted guest and his son for one night.  For the most part they were easy guests to host"".  I did take the opportunity to write private feedback to the guest and mentioned about the bed wetting, the trash, the key tag, and the communicating off platform.  The guest wrote back straight away and was super apologetic about all of it.  He didn't realise about the bed wetting (as someone mentioned that might be the case), he directed me to where the key tag was (went out of his way to take it off the key and put it into the lockbox, where it didn't fit anyway), the trash was just a mistake which he apologised for, and finally the communicating off platform he didn't realise that all comms had to go through Airbnb as he got a text message notification and thought it was ok to do things that way.  All in all, glad I came here to get (for the most part) some good, kind, and helpful advice.  Hopefully some good karma was made as per what u/Simply_Mat said.



--------------------------------------
☆☆☆

Just had a guest check out. They have multiple 5 star reviews to their name and plenty of ""welcome back anytime"" comments from other host's. For context, I've been an Airbnb superhost for 4 years now so I'm not green, just haven't had a guest quite like this before.


Guest booked for one night for one person. Guest arrived with his young son - 2 guests, not 1. 


Saw the guests check out early this morning and they seemed to have been no trouble....until I inspected the room. 


The key ring and tag that the room key goes on was missing. The key was there, just not the key ring and tag. Annoying to have to find another one but whatever.


Check the bins and dirty contaminated waste was put into the recycling bin. Our house rules are big on sustainability and appropriate waste management. 


Start to strip the beds. Dad's bed was fine. Kid's bed was soaked through all the sheets and blankets with urine. Thankfully the waterproof mattress protector did it's job and the mattress is dry. 


Obviously this is not a five star guest.  I don't want to shame the kid for bed wetting in the review but it's clear that he is not night time toilet trained.  It's only because of the waterproof mattress protector that my new mattress wasn't wrecked with pee.

I added a $40 cleaning fee, so even though the one night was just $22 (I let Airbnb pick the charge), I made around $62.  I'm ok with this, as I've read to trade very low payments for great reviews for at least the first five or more bookings.  I plan on slowly upping the fees as I get more bookings.  I right now have people coming in for just one night this weekend, and then a single man coming for three night next week.

I was nervous before they arrived, unsure what to do with myself.  It is just me and my dog in this four bedroom house, with one room serving also as an office.  I sleep/use one of the rooms that has an attached full bath, but allow guests to use the huge master bedroom with attached large full bath.  I am content with my bedroom/bath, and have no desire to use the master.

They arrived late, around 9PM.  It was four guys and two girls.  Three of the boys were mid teens.  One guy was early 20s and married to the oldest sister in her 20s, and then their mother was there who was  a much older lady.

They brought their own take out food, but I had bought lots of fruit and candy and had that all on the kitchen table.  They later said they really liked that.

I left the garage door opened as I had texted them, but they did want the garage code which I gave.  But they knocked on the inside door that leads to the kitchen, so I had go down to let them in.  I spent a few minutes saying hello and they met me and my dog who did an awesome job socializing.  The loved him and most spent time petting him.

I did my best to explain the house, where is what, and always stating things that they would find nice, being a host.  They all went to bed around the time I did about 10PM.

I got up the next morning and they were mostly already up.  I cooked 18 scrambled eggs, bacon and breakfast steak and sliced tomatoes.  They really enjoyed this and hid $20 under a plate for me, stating that I couldn't make money doing this at one point.

In their review, which was glowing, they described the big breakfast, and so I am now concerned that if I do not provide this to future guests, I'll get a bad review.

The only other thing that sticks out, is they were about to use my Grandmother's rare china, which is in the glassed cabinets.  I so happened to have just walked in and they had the door open with a hand on a plate, and they asked if they could use those, which tells me it was obvious that they were special dishes.  I nicely said I would rather them not, and use the common plates and showed where those were.  I suppose I need to put a sign on there to not use these, in a nice way.

Otherwise, I spent most the day yesterday doing laundry, running the Roomba, and plan to keep going in preparation for this weekend.

I also have found I need more blankets, sheets, towels, but mostly bedding stuff as they wanted to turn the futon into another bed making four beds in all.

Lastly, my dog's white, short hair is an obvious problem.  I guess I just blank it out.  He sleeps in my bed, but as I went to prep the other rooms, it seems his hair is everywhere.  I ordered the best de-hairing dog brush off amazon to begin regular brushings, which I've admittedly not done very often.

I am a superhost, and my places are in the Philippines. A prospective guest from a nearby province instant-booked one of my units for next week, which is pretty rare as most instant-bookings are made by foreigners and not locals. It was her first time using the platform. She was super sweet and respectful, but didn't mean to book instantly at all. [I explained to her what this meant, particularly in the context of my strict cancellation policy](https://i.imgur.com/7RDaiUS.png) (that is, her card was already charged).

[A few messages back and forth later](https://i.imgur.com/HIoHXxn.png), I told her I'd contact Airbnb on her behalf and request for her booking to be cancelled and payment refunded in full. She was so apologetic though and even [insisted that the booking go through despite everything](https://i.imgur.com/eIR4U2e.png); that it's a mistake she was willing to pay for. I figured it's really no skin off my back anyway and I didn't want to take advantage of someone else's naivity, so I called Airbnb's support hotline.

The agent I got was fairly surprised that a host made this request for his guest, and asked for some standard identification prompts. When that cleared, she said she'd contact me again after informing the guest. Minutes later, I got a callback from the same support agent and before hanging up, she commended me on the gesture. Not used to being praised for random acts of kindness, I fumbled through an awkward ""it's no big deal"" and didn't think to hang up on my end for like 6-7 seconds after we both stopped talking.

[The guest then messaged me](https://i.imgur.com/M9Ap2fK.png) saying Airbnb contacted her and we wished each other well. I figured that was the end of it, but nope. Apparently this is worthy of a gift basket? I had no idea Airbnb even rewarded superhosts, let alone acknowledged our efforts at providing guests basic customer support. Well, gift or no gift, I'd hope that most hosts would've been willing to do the same for a guest's honest mistake.

For some reason, I've had a few sets of guests this week ask for a late check-out to accommodate their very late flights.  The problem is not that they ask, it's that they ask me *at* check-out time!   It's not like they are flying stand-by and just discovered they can get on a 10pm flight, so why not ask in advance when maybe I can say yes?   

Asking at the very last minute means a big no because I've already scheduled the cleaning, figured out my timing for laundry, I've already planned the day, and I may have already said yes to other guests request to check in early.

My tip for guests is that if you want something extra, ask BEFORE the booking to see if your request can be accommodated.  I think most people book a flight first, then a place to stay, so you most likely already know the timing that works best for you.     If you forget to ask for a special favor before booking, ask before arrival.   If you forget to ask before arrival, ask during your stay - but whatever you do, know that asking for a special favor at the last second will usually result in a ""no"", at least from me.

adb0ccae-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,AirBnb Strategy Insight: Bad News for Hosts,"Having been a national brand marketing manager I have some insight into some of AirBnB's recent moves. 

1. They are creating new certifications for Hosts (AirBnB Plus, Family Collection, Work Collection). This is a way to ""premiumize"" AirBnB so that guests expect to pay more money. AirBnB benefits directly because they earn 18% off every booking. If guests pay more, AirBnB makes more.
2. Once hosts invest more money into ""premiumization"" to get their certificates, they have more incentive to stay with AirBnB to earn back their money. This gives AirBnB the power to raise Host fees or set new rules against Hosts' interests.
3. AirBnB understands that some hosts will be forced to lower their price to compete with these new ""premium"" listings, driving down prices overall. Lower prices attract more bookings, so AirBnB makes more money again.
4. The higher competition puts downward pressure on ""premium"" listings too, putting prices there back down to where they were. 
5. The result is AirBnB gets a short-term bump in ""premium"" bookings, then rates fall. Now, ""premium"" hosts are stuck with lower rates on a higher investment.
6. AirBnB is clearly shifting its T&Cs to favor guests. Now that AirBnB has enough Hosts, their focus is on increasing the number of guests.
7. Lower prices and better quality attracts more guests so AirBnB can now make more commission from lower nightly rates.

TL;DR, AirBnB's strategy is to trick Hosts into investing more money into their listing so AirBnB can make more money while Hosts earn less.

As I finish work at 03:00, my partner's alarms for work go off from 05:00 to 07:30 and I had to collect fresh bedding and towels from the launderette, it wasn't worth sleeping to accommodate the early check-in.

The guest then sent me a text at 10:15 (15 minutes after they were supposed to arrive), telling me that he had just left home and would be here in two hours.

When the guest arrived, I told him that he could let me know if he needed anything or there were any problems, but told him that I would be going to sleep so I would not be able to respond.

Everything was fine while they were here. Upon checkout they left some of their belongings behind. He knew that I was sleeping, but the guy sent 8 texts in 5 minutes asking 'Why aren't you answering the door bro?????'.

This was followed up with another text an hour later, where he said that he would be coming back in the afternoon to collect their belongings and he wasn't happy that he had been 'knocking for 15 mins man'.

There was then another text a couple of hours later where he said 'Seriously????? Ur not going 2 answer me????'

He knew that I was sleeping while the texts were sent, but for some reason he expected me to wake up when they were received. At no point did he think to call.

tldr:

A guest asks for an early check in, which prevents me from being able to sleep, then doesn't leave home until the time he told me they would arrive without communicating that they would be late.

He then barrages me with texts when I am sleeping asking why I am not opening the door for them when they return to collect forgotten belongings after check out.

adb0d3e8-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Vital information for Texas hosts regarding tenancy.(30 days is NOT necessary) Relevant to Harvey evacuees.,"I keep seeing people posting about needing to stay for 30 days to establish tenancy and it is WRONG concerning Texas.  Maybe it is true in other states, but not in Texas.

According to the Texas property code, a tenant is anyone covered by a lease, and a lease *can* be an oral agreement that they can stay in your property for money. As it is interpreted by the police, if you let someone stay in your place for money, they are a tenant, instantly.





The bottom line is, the cops will NOT remove a non-paying tenant from your property. They will tell you it is a civil matter and that you have to evict. To evict in Texas is expensive and will take at least 4 weeks, maybe 6. (You have to wait for a court date, then wait for an appointment for the Constables to come.)

There is a separate code for hotels or legitimate B and Bs, which have a hotel license from the city, something 99.9% of Airbnb hosts do not have. Cops can use force to remove people from hotels, but unless you can show them a hotel license, you are not one.


If *you* forcibly remove a tenant, then YOU are breaking the law and can be arrested and are also civilly liable (you can be sued).  So, the bottom line is, **be careful who you let in your place, and make sure they have a reason to go back home.** Source: I have had to evict 3 tenants (before Airbnb), and I have read the Texas Property Code (all 46 pages)

adb0db04-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,What a $1500 mistake as a software engineer taught me about being a host,"**You’re going it alone**

  


I studied business and computer science back in school, and found the majority of my friends to be engineers. While those relationships were extremely valuable and continue to this day, I also found myself continuing to carry one of the shortcomings of many software engineers: an inexhaustible need to get things for free (frameworks, plugins, packages) and build it myself.


  



To make websites, developers have to find a computer that is willing to host their code: a server. Generally, there are two ways to do this 1) buy a hosting solution, or 2) obtain and configure your own server. When I first had the opportunity to develop a professional website, I smugly thought I’d be able to do it completely for free. Download a free website design from the Internet, upload the code to a free server via a promotion that Amazon offered, and go from there.


  



Little did I know that hours after I had built and uploaded my website, the site would crash. And even after I restarted the service that ran the server, the site would continue to crash. To put it simply: I had no experience in organizing and programming server computers, and my server had no capacity to handle multiple simultaneous connections. Once more than 8 people would log on, it would inevitably crash. Because I thought I was locked into Amazon’s system at the time, I uploaded the code to a different type of server, configured the database to work through Amazon’s services, and thought I was set.


  



One month later, the cost for that database service was $1500. 


  



To put that into perspective, a perfectly decent hosting service with 24/7 up time, can cost up to $30 a month. So, in one month, had I just realized the value in letting someone else do a job better than me, I would have saved the equivalent of 50 months of an outsourced service. 


  



What does this mean for an Airbnb host?


  



When you operate an Airbnb, you are simultaneously property manager, interior decorator, head of hospitality, concierge, customer service, and cleaning. Chance are, when you looked into being an Airbnb host, you were only interested in some portions of this job. 


  



Unfortunately for me, when I was just starting out as a host, I carried the same ego from software engineering into being a host. I thought: “I know what clean is. I know how to decorate a room. I can do this.” 


  



And so, while people generally liked my room, I often got poor ratings for cleanliness and the overall room. Reviews would complain that the toilet was dirty, or the bathtub had a stain on it, or my roommates would leave dishes in the sink. Needless to say, seeing my cleanliness score drop was very disheartening. 


  



All of that started to change when I finally hired cleaners. At $75 a visit, a week, they’re not cheap: but they make sure the toilets, bathtub, and kitchen are spotless. Not to mention, they change the sheets, vacuum the floor, and generally give me peace of mind. As long as I can make money off Airbnb, I will be happy to pay them.
 

  


“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”, goes the popular expression. And especially in this day of modern technology, you can increasingly find teams of individuals to help you if you compensate them well. And while few people are ready to pay $75 a week for professional cleaners to clean their home, here’s a list of ideas to help you from doing less work, and creating more value:

* Find yourself answering the same question often? I wrote all the instructions for how to get into my house in a “Saved Message” for Airbnb and have used it for every guest since then.
* Find yourself having to stay home to welcome your guests in person? Find a local store to hold your key for you, and be sure to tip generously. Alternative, invest in a numpad or electronic lock, even a smartlock.
* Are you running out of toilet paper, paper towels, toiletries, and other miscellaneous household items? Use Subscribe & Save on Amazon to automate those biweekly detergent deliveries and eliminate it from your mind.
* Find yourself answering the same questions about “Where to eat X? Where to buy X? What places to see?”? Write a city guide on Airbnb, or type one and print it out. You can even use a travel app like https://stamp.travel to digitize the process and save paper. 

  


On a final note, automating and outsourcing parts of your work doesn’t mean you’re above it. I still regularly wash sheets, fold them, and prepare beds for my guests. But if I was to do this for *every single guest*, I would hardly have enough time to do other things where I am better equipped to create value, not to mention having help reduces the stress that I as a host have to handle. Learn to employ the help of other people, and you’ll find yourself a happy host, free to focus on and do the things you really enjoy about the Airbnb hosting process.",0.9,32,1478565400.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/5bq26u/what_a_1500_mistake_as_a_software_engineer_taught/,True,30

adb0ddde-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"""I'm a rich analyst and my BF works in tech, can we have a discount?""","Just wanting to vent about a particularly silly request from a would-be host. I host a room in my home in Silicon Valley. I often host traveling tech employees who must visit their home office for a work week, people here on job interviews, etc. A room in a bad hotel is at least $200 here because of the substantial demand. I, on the other hand, price my room affordably, because it allows me to host some interesting people like traveling journalists, entrepreneurs who don't have much funding, folks moving here looking for a week's accommodations before starting their lease, etc. I am below the average price of a room in my market, but not rock bottom. I charge an extra $10/night for a second guest; this is also below the average price of a room for 2 in my market. 

Today, not only was I asked for a discount, but the intro message stated that one was an analyst taking their CFA exam, and the other one was an intern at LinkedIn (hint: those interns are paid very well, as are all summer interns at large reputable tech companies like Google etc.). the message even stated that they were both going to stay with me because Linkedin PROVIDED the BF with housing, but it was a shared BF with another male coworker (in my market, any housing is a godsend and the fact that they found the offer of shared housing unacceptable says a lot about how out of touch their expectations are). It wasn't just the GF that expected to stay with me, they both would be staying. Oh, but they only want to put down that SHE would be staying there. They wanted the price for one person, and then asked for a discount because of the ""substantial"" cost of the extra person. the full cost of that second person over the ENTIRETY of their stay came to less than the price of ONE DAY at the worst hotel in a 10-mile radius. I, on the other hand, am within WALKING distance of Linkedin. 

Perhaps this is a cultural thing, but it blows my mind that they're asking for a discount when 1) they could have booked someplace cheaper in the first place, 2) i'm less than half the cost of a shitty hotel and I have solid 5 stars across the board, and 3) I'm obviously much cheaper than many options out there, so i'm already competitive on my price in the market, . The guest also asked EXACTLY how many miles to linkedin my home was, and EXACTLY how they would get there by public transportation (emphasis theirs). More work than the average guest and not wanting to pay the very reasonable asking price? NOPE.

They also did that lovely thing where they inquire about one block of dates and then slip in the message that they intend to stay past that request (booking request had check-out on the 12th but the message indicated they would actually be staying until the 15th.)

adb0df46-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,What I look for and why when I'm guest.,"I've spent a few years being a guest and a superhost.  I see a lot of hosts who really dislike hosting and a lot of guests who got the short end of the stick.  For me, I have been fortunate to have amazing guests, yeah some have ate our entire complimentary food selection or made noise, but, it's part of the art of doing business in your home.When I'm a guest I have a list I strive to match when booking non business rentals.

&#x200B;

1. **Hosts with single listing** \- I've found this eliminates hosts who have a ""business"" in airbnb or who have subcontracted with management firms for their airbnb.
2. **Private Room w/ non-shared bathroom** \- This completely removes the chance of a house that's in bad shape, and it allows me to get to know the host when we pass. Also, never had a heating, cooling, wifi, xyzzy problem when the host has to share it with me.
3. **Self Check In-** An absolutely must. Too often the email cat and mouse game of ""when are you coming, when are you leaving, blah blah blah"" adds to the stress of a million other apps and travel services ""reminding"" me of things.
4. **Super Hosts** \- Super host work their butts off, I know I am one. They also have learned the art of understanding that airbnb is a business, their business and not every customer is going to be a gem.
5. **Instabook** \- I get a lot of push back from ""hosts"" on there because this is too much to ask. I should be more patient with the 24 hour window. Unfortunately, I'm traveling weekly around the globe and some times I don't have a 24 hour window.
6. **Reviews** \- Since the host is only hosting ONE property, all the host reviews are about that property, something that a lot of folks make the mistake of when the first sign up. They see a bunch of good reviews for a host, but then find out, the host has five rooms or six places.
7. **First floor -** Many hosts (especially Europe) don't list multiple floor units. So you end up jet lagged with 50lbs in bags dragging up 4-5-6 floors, no elevator. It feels like death.
8. **A/C -** Not an issue six months a year, but man, those other six months, MAKE SURE YOU CHECK for AC
9. **Check in/out:**  Checkin between 1-3 / Check out between 10-11 (Some hosts have outrageous check-ins like 5-9pm or check outs like 9am. You basically pay for 12 hours.
10. **Wordy Descriptions:** Big read flag, a host that has a multiple copied descripont in the listing. For example the house rules will be in the property description etc. Means the host has never ""viewed"" their listing as a customer.

That's it. If you're new to using Airbnb, try it out, find search parameters that work for you.  If you're thinking about listing your place on airbnb, there are tons of sites with amazing suggestions, but I often tell people if you want to list, first spend 3 months STAYING at airbnb's find out what you don't like. Find out what you love.  Then become the type of place YOU would want to stay at.

Finally, if you're a host and you're just feeling burned out, give it a break for a while.  It's important that airbnb is enjoyable and not just profitable for you.",0.91,33,1574545586.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/e0oot8/what_i_look_for_and_why_when_im_guest/,True,19

I even spent 2 of those nights out of the home b/c the host weirded me out. 

I'm also kind of afraid that my candidness regarding her behavior and the noise in her home may prompt her to review me even more negatively. Maybe that's just part of the trade, but I'd like to be prepared. What specifically will future hosts see after she posts her public review of me? I know there's a rating system of some kind and I'd like to know what other hosts will see once they're screening me.

Can anyone clue me in on how guests are reviewed and rated? 
 ___
**Edit:** Just for clarity and because people have asked if I ever tried talking to her...

I did indeed sit down with the host last week about my concerns regarding her lack of tact, the noise past 1 am (which I didn't even mention before), and what seems to be a lack of personal boundaries. She was dismissive in her attitude and said I was being ""overly sensitive"" regarding the weight comments and that she gets it because it ""sucks for me because she's thin."" She also said it was ""dramatic"" that I was asking for her full attention while talking to her about these issues. In the ensuing days, she continued singing loudly in common spaces, played her trumpet which made the place noisy but I tolerated it b/c it wasn't at night. Yesterday, she knocked on my door and then came in without even waiting for a reply by me. This was the last straw for me and I called AirBnb/ended my stay here.

I had a last convo with the host and she said that in her original listing she asks for guests to ""announce when they're home or when they're leaving"" so she can adjust noise accordingly. Yes, because every guest wants to constantly report to the host when they're present or not (/s). The noise also continued past 1 am. 

AirBnb ended up crediting back the full amount of the nights I did not stay here which ended up being $530.  Because I was without a place to stay, they generously gave me a $60 coupon to use for the next booking.",1.0,30,1550711249.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/aswm7w/want_to_post_an_honest_review_of_the_host_but_im/,True,24

I booked a private room on Airbnb and everything was great! She got right in contact with me as soon I booked it. She told me the pass was sketchy coming from Portland. She was so nice and accommodating.

Well, it’s around 9:15pm and I head out for a drink with a friend and she tells me that I can park in front of the garage and I can come in as late as I want and that she has to be up by 5am for work, but that she and her husband can sleep through an earthquake. 

Well... I leave and come back around 1:15am. I walk through the door and see legs in the hallway. I look to see what the heck is happening and my Airbnb host is passed out on the step from her sunken living room, with keys in hand and jeans unbuttoned (she was not wearing underwear if you know what I mean). Her head was on the living room floor, back on the stair, and legs up on the main level. (I have a pic but I don’t wanna post that to the public)

I start freaking out trying to wake her up.. nothing. I look around and see that her bedroom door is open and the light is on but her husband is passed out in bed. (Remember she said he can sleep through an earthquake?) I try to wake him up by talking loudly, poking him, pushing him a lil, NOTHING. I’m tempted to wake the son up but I didn’t want to scare him and have him see his mother like that. 

Finally, I get her *somewhat* conscious. She starts mumbling words and tries to get up but can’t so I help her sit up. She tries putting on her boots and I’m like “whoaaaaa, how about we get you in bed?” Doesn’t respond. Tries to lean back and almost passes out AGAIN. I try to talk to her again and she finally look at me and I say again “wanna go to bed?” She says “you would do that?” 

I help her from the living room into her bedroom (going up and down a couple stairs). I help her take off her jacket, put her in bed (with her husband still in bed), put her keys on her nightstand, turn off the light, and close the door. 

What the fucking hell did I come back to?!? She seemed like she was drunk, but she also obviously fell so I’m worried about a concussion. What the fuck should I do in the morning? Or at all? Do I tell AirBnb? Should I give her a bad review?

 Oh my god that was insane. She’s probably going to be so embarrassed, if she remembers. 

TLDR: I came back to my wonderful Airbnb host passed out on a stair and I had to take her back to her room and put her in bed. 

EDIT: I woke up and she was gone. Saw the husband and he just said hello and left. I didn’t really have a chance to talk to him or have the nerve to say anything anyways. 

I just want to clarify that I’m 22F so this was just something I didn’t know how to handle. I took the picture, not to post it, but to text my mom and ask her what to do.

I’m not going to leave a bad review. Just not worth it. She has 130+ good reviews so I know this isn’t a common thing. She was really nice when I did talk to her sober.

adb0f616-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Surely I'll get a bad review... anything I can do about it,"Hi all.  I figured I'd seek some third party advice from folks who are well versed in all this.  So here's the story:

**TL;DR** host throws underage rager with no warning, screams at me when I express discomfort, tells me to get out of house with police in front yard, we still review each other?

**11/2 update** I have been through 5 case managers now. Still no resolution. I have requested phone conversation transcripts of my support calls and still haven’t heard back. Apparently my case manager has been changed to someone else from #4 (who was actually helpful). I don’t know what else to do with this company!

I was on a placement for school and had a month long reservation in a private room with a shared bathroom.  From the start, this was less than ideal (and naive me with no bad experiences didn't know to report).  The host was 30 minutes late meeting me, what was listed as a full bed was actually a twin futon on the floor with host-admitted unwashed sheets.  I was nice as could be and allowed my host time to tidy things up and let the minor annoyances that sprung up during my time there slide.

&#x200B;

What brought me over the edge was the ""small party, with a couple friends"" that was actually 30 cars on the front lawn, music shaking the house and a house full of obliterated-drunk 18-19 year olds.  I came home to this and when I grabbed her to talk to her about how this wasn't my understanding and I'm uncomfortable, she was pretty clearly drunk and told me to get out of her house and screamed I was disrespecting her in her home.  I hold a professional license and this stuff is a career-ender for me, and reported what was going on to the police who came and she wouldn't let in the home. (Before you assume I'm a massive dick, realize I'm in a state where as an adult if I'm even in the house I could get stung) I packed my things up and phoned airbnb who agreed to comp me for a hotel for the night.  In front of the police as I left, the host screamed she was changing the door code and I was to leave immediately.  I panicked and got everything out as fast as I could and the room is certainly a mess with food items, soda, etc. left behind in the fridge.

&#x200B;

Anyways, we go through the runaround with Airbnb and I get the remaining nights of my stay (no taxes or fees) back plus the hotel.  Initially the claim was denied, until another case manager took it over.  Even though a refund is in process, the reservation is still listed as active and the case manager I spoke with told me I'm still going to be reviewed and I can review her.

&#x200B;

Guidance on where to go from here?  What can I do to protect myself?  I've had nothing but good experiences and 5 star guest reviews until now.

adb0f8e6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Update: Private bath is not so private (3rd stay in progress),"Previous Post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/997oze/private_bath_is_not_so_private_3rd_stay_in/

AirBnb asked me to open a resolution center claim to process a refund for my stay. I opened one and attached images including the message where the host admitted someone was staying/using the bathroom.

I didn't receive a reply from the host, so I escalated and got Airbnb involved. The case rep today called me to tell me:

1) She has educated the host about what is private and what is shared, and he has changed the listing to shared.

2) She cannot process my refund because it has been more than 24 hours.

I pleaded with the case rep but she didn't understand. When I asked for what private means, she replied back and I kid you not - ""In a private room listing, all other facilities and amenities including the bathroom can be shared. If you want a private bath then book an entire house"".

When I checked the host's listing again, it still says '1 Private Bath' and 'Second Full Bath Just for Guest'. I told her the change hasn't been made to shared (as she claimed during 1st call) and she said she spoke with her supervisor and they decided that 'Second Full Bath Just for Guest' means anyone in the house can use it, including the private rental guests in the other room.

The rep told me she asked the host if he would like to issue a refund. He obviously said no. Based on the host's reply, she made a decision to decline my refund request. I don't even know where to begin. Isn't the resolution center rep/manager supposed to be making a decision independently and then enforcing their decision? 

My 2 calls with the case rep were easily the worst calls I've experienced. Poor decision-making skills, no empathy/clarity and a serious lack of understanding of the situation. Every line of hers began with a robotic ""I apologize"".

Apparently, we were the third AirBNB location he stayed at on this trip. The first one had AC problems the first night, they stayed the night in an 87 degree room and spoke with the host the next morning and got a refund for the last few days of their stay. No worries. The second location had 2  twin beds in the room but clearly showed a queen size in the pictures and description. He spoke with the host and explained that it was their anniversary and they wanted a romantic time at the beach. The host told them to cancel and he would refund their money. So he cancelled and found my place. The previous host would not respond to him so he opened a case with Support and she would not answer their calls either. He assumed the lady had good intentions but clearly she doesn’t. 

So, for any first time AirBNBers or anyone who has used the platform extensively but never had any problems, here are some ground rules:

- Nobody’s word is Oak. If they made commitments or promises outside the AirBNB message app, IT DIDN’T FUCKING HAPPEN. 

- A handshake isn’t worth the sweat exchanged while doing it. If a host makes a commitment or promise to you in person and they intend to honor it, they should have no problem if you ask them to confirm that promise through the app. If they have reservations about sending that promise through the app, DON’T HIT CANCEL.

My apartment is advertised as being near the beach. 

This is factually true: according to Google Maps, it is 450 feet away. That’s a 2 minute walk, max. You can see the sand from the end of my block, and you can actually hear the waves in the unit. When you see the little bubble that shows my approximate location on the listing, part of the circle is literally over the ocean. 

I found it funny when this guest told me she couldn’t find it, but I chalked it up to her being turned around in a new place and gave her directions (Exit door. Turn right. Walk to beach.). I thought that was the end of it. 

Lo and behold, my spatially-challenged friend left a review saying that my apartment was a 10 minute drive from the beach and my listing was false advertising.

Let me repeat: this lady couldn’t find the largest body of water on the planet from 450 feet away, modern mapping technology be damned. 

Most of all I just found this story funny, but I am also a bit worried since we’re a new listing and the beach is the best reason to visit. I politely responded to crazy lady’s comment, but is this dispute-worthy? I mean, the physical proximity of my apartment to the beach is hard to dispute, and the guest had the address weeks before the booking so she could have looked at a map and cancelled if it wasn’t close enough for her. 

Anyway, I’m not sure if there’s anything I can or should do, besides hope that my future guests can correctly read maps.

Hi, I've been a super host for years now, with fairly smooth sailing.
 Last night I was surprised with a message from Airbnb customer support:

Hours after checking out of a 7 night stay, my Australian guest (with good reviews) complained to Airbnb (not me) that he and his gf suffered ""the worst sleep of our lives"" due to a rodent scratching near the walls of the bed. They were so terrified of the scratching sound they slept on a small couch in the living room. 

This was never communicated to me during their stay. In fact, inside Airbnb messaging, he said ""Thanks so much for letting a stay in your fantastic place,"" the day of the checkout. No complaints. 

I live in the building, directly underneath the rental apartment.  I have never seen a rat or a possum. However, if I had received a complaint I absolutely would have called an exterminator.  Also this sort of blindsided me for my future guests. I now have to scramble to find an exterminator before the next stay!

The Airbnb customer support guy wants my reply...My guess is they are looking for a reason to make me refund the guest (about $800), who will likely be refunded regardless.   

I feel like I'm going to get burned by a bad review. What do you guys recommend I say to Airbnb?",0.93,30,1561992616.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/c7thms/after_his_check_out_guest_complains_possumrat/,True,15

They all range in age so it appears to be a large family.  

The booking clearly states 4 people.  I have a $75 per additional person fee.  We could probably accommodate 5 people comfortably.  San Diego laws would allow a max of 6 people in a home this size.

After sleeping through it (because I did not want to make decisions when emotions are high), I've decided to terminate the remainder of his stay. I called AirBnB to ensure if there are any associated fees, and they said that they'd just refund the nights he didn't stay. They told me that they would call the guest and inform them of this, but I told them to call him after 15 minutes as I prefer to deliver the news to him (I don't like confrontation myself, but I felt that it made sense that I deliver the bad news). After he and I talked, I told him that I wouldn't write any negative review about him, so he wouldn't face difficulty looking for a new place to stay at.

He seemed like  a nice kid who was just looking to start out in a new city, but I just had to draw the line for my own comfort. I didn't want to worry for the next 2 nights. 

Lesson learned: Before they check-in, I'll reiterate my house rules. 

To those not in the know, I had quiet hours from 11PM-7AM posted as a House Rule, and it's a 1 maximum occupancy bedroom. He brought in people with the intention of at least one of them  (a girl) staying over for the night.

&#x200B;

So, lady books my private room in a shared house a week ago for her, her husband, her son and his girlfriend. She immediately asks for a noon checkin. I explain that there are guests leaving at 11:00 but I will do everything I can to get the room ready as close to noon as possible.

&#x200B;

Three days later, 4 days before checkin, she asks if there is an address. I tell her that she should be able to get to the address and turn by turn directions from the app but give her the address as well.

&#x200B;

Her reply was immediately, ""Wait, so we are sharing the house with ya'll?"". That seemed out of place but people have booked before thinking they were getting a whole house despite it mentioning the fact that it is a shared location 9 different times in the listing. I also assumed she probably realized it was in a shared house when she went into the app to look for the address after I mentioned it.

&#x200B;

2 days later and 2 days before the checkin, she asks if we have beach chairs. I tell her that we do have beach chairs, towels, umbrellas and beach blankets they are welcome to use, as well as a beach cart to tote it all down to the water with. She replied with, ""How many beach chairs?"" and I told her 6.

&#x200B;

They arrive today with no further communication and showed up with her, her husband, her son, his girlfriend and Nana. Nana was immediately very concerned about the shared space and asked a lot of questions about if they were allowed to use the kitchen, etc. I had to leave for a previous commitment at 4:00 but the husband seemed perfectly content and was more interested in how to get March Madness games on the big screen than anything else.

&#x200B;

He calls me about a half hour ago and tells me that Nana is not comfortable with the shared house situation and they are leaving.

&#x200B;

So, at this point, I think I have a few options:

* Issue a full refund to try and and avoid a negative review and be out $600 for a Spring Break booking that I probably would be lucky to recoup half of.
* Issue a partial refund and hope its enough to stave off a bad review and still recoup some of the $600 listing. I considered holding off on giving them an amount and refunding them any of the 5 days they were to stay that I am able to rent the space.
* Call AirBNB and try and stave off any chance of a review by suggesting they violated the terms by showing up with more people than they booked for.

Thoughts? Ideas? I am a regular contributor on here and it is usually easier to advise on these situations when the questions don't actually involve your own wallet or listing so I would love to hear your opinions.

Guest says he and his friends will be in town over the weekend to tour a local university his sister is currently at.

I'm sure the side door was an accident. The messiness of the place is also frustrating as it took me double the time if not longer to clean everything up.

From what I know, my Houston reviews which were all five star raves can be seen by guest looking to book here. 

My very first guest were only here for three days and the stay went well. But when I opened their review the first comment was, “despite all the bad reviews we decided to check this out for ourselves.” I was confused - they were my first guest here and first review here and if they read my Houston ones there wasn’t anything close to being bad in any of them. 

But then it got more confusing. A few more sentences down they said they enjoyed my swimming pool. I don’t have a swimming pool. At this point I figured they had stayed in more than one place and mixed reviews up. I messaged them but got no reply. 

I then contacted Airbnb to ask that this wrong review be removed and they told me because it was a good review (all five stars) they wouldn’t remove it because it was the “guests perception of their stay.” I stepped it up and asked it be re-evaluated because as my first review, it gave the idea bad one had been visible to others before and that future guest may review me poorly because they expected a pool per reviewer.  Airbnb stuck to their decision. 

Now I get messaged on occasion asking why the pool isn’t in my pictures or if they have to pay extra to access the pool. I knew it would be an issue. 

If I had reviewed that these guest took a dump in my front yard even though it wasn’t true, would Airbnb defend my statement because it was my perception of their stay and leave the review as long as I rated them highly?

Would someone please start another renters platform that is like Airbnb when it first started? I’m getting half the support and twice the hassles as when I started as a host years ago.

Our flight arrived late in the evening and we set up a checkin after hours for an additional 50 pounds.  Not a big deal, someone would meet us there, check our ID and give us a set of keys.  We arrive a few minutes before the time we scheduled and wait.  Nobody shows up.  We wait a little longer, contact the host which ends up being a third party management company.  They assure us someone is on their way.  Half hour passes by and still nobody arrives.  They decide to set up a self check in (why couldn't they have done this in the first place....oh another way to make a little extra money).  We're given the location and code to a lock box.  I look all around and cant find it, turns out they gave us the wrong information.  Finally get the correct information from these people and get into the flat 1 hour after someone was supposed to meet us there.  I want to enjoy my trip and not deal with any nonsense, so I let this go and don't argue about the fee.

Here's where it gets better.  Seeing as we only brought a small backpack each, we knew we would have to do laundry in our AirBnBs so made sure to book ones with access to a washer and dryer.  The flat has a 2 in 1 front load machine located in the kitchen.  On our second night we decided to do a small load of laundry.  Wash cycle runs fine, switch it over to dry, run a short cycle and try and open the door.  I cant get it open.  Switch it off and back to dry and it opens, but the clothes are still damp.  I start another dry cycle and when it finishes the door won't unlock.  I Google the problem with that particular model and find that it can be a common issue.  Contact the host (management company) and they skirt around this issue, apologizing for the inconvenience, but not ever trying to solve the problem.  This is 2.5 days before were scheduled to leave.  I contact them every few hours and they finally tell me they are sending over an electrician the night before we are to depart.  He comes by and doesn't try to unlock the door, but immediately assumes we operated the machine incorrectly and tells us it's on pause.  He starts a 2.5 hour wash cycle, says it should unlock when it finishes.  I honestly don't think this guy can find a fuse box if he had to, but I listened and let it finish the cycle.  Sure enough it doesn't unlock, so I sent a message to the host asking for a handyman or someone to come by before we leave in the morning.  I tell them we are not leaving our clothes and I'd hate to force open the door and cause damage.  They dont message me until a half hour before we have to leave to catch our train.  They completely ignored the issue and instead told us we couldn't extend our stay.  I never asked to extend our stay.  All I asked for and wanted was help to retrieve our clothes.  We waited until the last minute for any sort of communication from them and they completely ignored the issue so I had to force open the door, which wasn't easy and definitely damaged the machine.  

I imagine I'll have a negative review left on my account and be asked for money to repair the machine.  I gave them ample time to do the right thing and they didn't.  If Airbnb decides to take the hosts side in this ordeal, I'll have to dispute the charge with my bank.  Going forward I'll make sure not to book with any of these third party management companies.

TLDR:  clothes get stuck in washing machine, host is unresponsive, forced to break the door open to retrieve clothes.  ",0.88,30,1546009192.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/aaazoe/not_a_great_experience/,True,23
adb13a72-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Purpose of cleaning fee? Something I am misunderstandin?,"Hi. Just came from a holiday in Spain after staying 9 nights in a nice villa with the family. Paid around 200 dollars per night. 
Received a pretty harsh review from my host for not cleaning up before I leaving. The complaint consisted of not washing the towels( I hanged the use towels over the shower)
Not cleaning the bed sheets(left these on the beds did not make up the bed before leaving)
Dirty dishes(left around 4-5 unwashed glasses etc in the sink)
Dirty table(I did not wash over the tables before we left)
I also left some trash in plastic bags but did not receive a complaint about this.

I paid 100 dollars in cleaning fees and thought that covered the cleaning. I felt the complaint was unfair as IMO a 100 dollar cleaning fees should cover these things. My question is; am I wrong? Should I have cleaned up the place to a tidy standard before leaving and expect the cleaning fee to cover nothing? 

Ps: nothing was stated about what was included in the cleaning fee.

Edit: Spelling + Thanks for all the feedback everyone. With your help, I will definitely avoid similar situations in the future thanks to the different answers I got from most of you guys :)
I also called AirBnB to get their perspective, the man I spoke to basically said that I should get the instructions for cleaning in writing before arriving to avoid these situations. Which gives you stronger arguments in case either party complains about how the cleaning was done.

adb13be4-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"A literal shitshow, need advice","I’m hoping to get some advice on how to handle a literally shitty situation.
I had a guest stay two days. His profile showed that he’s a superhost with over 80 reviews. He booked on the same day of the stay for the wrong number of guests (we charge more for additional guests as we want to stay affordable for people who travel for work during the week plus we pay extra taxes per guest). 
Our listing is a tiny house with a modern composting toilet where you have to sit down to do your business even if you’re a male. This separates liquid from solids (there’s a separate trap door you open to go number 2) and keeps everything clean and smelling good. The solids are dried out by a vent that runs continually and exhausts outside to prevent any odor and speed up composting. There are some brief and clear instructions posted in the bathroom. The fact that we’re mostly off grid is a feature and most of our guests book us specifically because they want to experience tiny house living. We’re about 120 guests in and have never had a problem with this until now: these guests didn’t follow instructions at all and peed directly into the solids compartment, flooded the bathroom and then let it fester presumably since their first day. Instead of my normal cleaning I had to completely disassemble the toilet to get the urine out of all the books and crannies where it shouldn’t have ever been and mop the whole place several different times. 
I’m not sure what to do at this point. The place smelled terrible and I can’t imagine that they would give us a good review because people who don’t read directions probably don’t think they are the cause of the problem. When I checked in with them via message twice during their stay they didn’t respond at all. The guy who made the reservation said he’d leave the extra charge for the additional guest in cash before he arrived but he didn’t  which I again see as a sign of disgruntlement. 
What would you do? Wait and hope they don’t leave a review? Get in touch and tell them they didn’t follow the rules hence the flooding of the bathroom and risk them getting even more disgruntled triggering a bad review or possibly embarrassing them enough that that don’t? Get in touch with Airbnb over the fact that he brought in an extra guest (and offered to make an off app payment ? Would this be enough to make that possible review go away?). 
Other than the non communication and the terrible shit show they left the rest of the tiny house in decent shape.  Any advice is welcome.


*Edit: Thanks for the advice. I think I mostly wanted validation in a moment of frustration. I already have one bad review from someone a few months back who turned on the heat in the middle of summer and then complained that the ac was inedequate so I was being a bit paranoid that  another bad review wouldn’t leave us any wiggle room for the occasional “loved everything” 4 star review. I decided to tap into my more compassionate side  and sent him a kindly worded note saying I noticed the flooding, that it was due to improper use and that I wish he’d gotten in touch on the first day of his stay so I could have cleaned up so he wouldn’t have to spend an additional day in a tiny house in those conditions (it smelled SO bad!). I will leave him an honest review that doesn’t go into detail as to not embarrass him or scare his guests. Hopefully he doesn’t slam me but if he does, at least I saw it coming. 
I knew this day would come but I always assumed it would be a drunk college kid or someone who doesn’t speak English to mess up, not another Airbnb superhost! Thanks again for all the good comments.",0.97,29,1541785113.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/9vmhrd/a_literal_shitshow_need_advice/,True,21

“wash hands after going to the bathroom. I find it weird when people don’t do this and I can tell from the sound if the toilet flushes and the faucet doesn’t come on immediately after.” WTF? Her highlighting that she can hear people going to the bathroom and listens to it creeped me TF out. 

That was my personal favorite but there were several that bothered me such as: no eating or drinking anything but water in the living room because of white carpet, no interacting with neighbors or being around the complex too much (I’m guessing she’s not allowed to host per her lease), and closing doors has to be done by turning the knob not just pushing it closed. There were other gems but I’ll keep it tight. 

It was absolutely crazy and I never would have booked it had I known the insane restrictions, which I’m guessing she did on purpose because no one in their right mind would’ve booked it. ",0.87,28,1539128373.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/9mub7i/house_manual_lists_rules_that_werent_in_the_house/,True,25

I am just over one week into a 9 week stay and have been having serious conflicts with my host. I'm not sure if I can attest this to cultural conflict, but I have been embarassingly berated in front of other guests, have been yelled at for not cooking for others on evenings I don't even eat (there is no schedule or anything, this was bizarre to me), and have been presented with a 68 euro ""food charge"" for food I did not eat. Her behaviour with me makes me extremely uncomfortable in this place. This is all contradictory to what is in the house rules. Every encounter with the host ranges from somewhat rude to downright hostile.

Unfortunately, she uses the ""strict"" cancellation policy. If I cancel, I am out about $900. How do refunds work in situations like this?

adb1459e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guest smashed our TV but don’t know how to prove it.,"Hey everyone, long time lurker and first time poster. My partner and I have hosted our apartment our on Airbnb for the past 4 months and so far it’s been going amazingly well - some odd guests but nothing too out of the ordinary. 

At the moment we’ve got self check-in as we’re often very busy with work and can’t always be there to greet our guests, but they can always call us if they’re having trouble finding the lockbox etc.

At around 9.00pm last night we got a call from our current guest asking for a bit of help finding the lockbox, and all was well and good after 30 seconds walking her through the steps. 

Not 5 minutes after she checked in we received a message from her on Airbnb with a photo of our brand new TV with a completely smashed screen, the picture all distorted, saying “Hi is the TV broken?” 

We called her immediately, obviously quite embarrassed that we missed a previous guest’s issue that would impact on her stay, and tried to reassure her that we would get to the bottom of this and get a new TV out to her right away so it wouldn’t impact too heavily on her time in our apartment.

The only issue is that the picture she sent us has some features that are ringing alarm bells in our head.

First of all, we’ve contacted the previous guests and all said that the TV was working just fine while they were there. Obviously the guest before this current one could have been lying, but we have a team of two very reliable cleaners who work very thoroughly and said that there was nothing wrong with the screen when they were cleaning. 

Secondly, in the photo that our current guest sent us, all of the wires behind the TV have all been pulled and tangled around the unit, making it appear that the TV had fallen over and placed back on the unit without tidying up all the cables. A bar speaker at the front of the TV also normally has its cable neatly placed behind the TV, but in this case it was turned around with the cable coming out and over the unit, again looking like someone had just placed it back up on the unit. Our cleaners would never leave the wires looking in such a mess and were adamant that it did not look like this after they had been there. 

Obviously we could suspect that the cleaners accidentally broke it and are lying, but they have been incredibly reliable and have been with us for months, sending us photos after each clean and even letting us know if ever anything went wrong - no matter how small. I honestly trust them completely, and am almost certain they would immediately let us know if they accidentally broke anything. Even if they did lie and try to cover it up, there’s no way they would’ve left the entire unit looking like a complete mess either.

So overall we have two options. 
1. Someone broke into our 7th floor secured apartment to smash our TV and do nothing else.
2. The current guest is lying and did break it.



I guess my biggest question is how we can go about addressing this? Obviously I don’t want to pay ~$1200 for a new TV over something that a guest has done, but other forum topics of similar situations with Airbnb haven’t been particularly encouraging... Any tips would be much appreciated! ",0.86,27,1531033854.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8wzvcs/guest_smashed_our_tv_but_dont_know_how_to_prove_it/,True,27

Not sure why they would make such a significant change without active notice to hosts, but it's real, and it applies to you, too!**

I am a superhost and aspire to always respond to communications within a day (and during waking hours, within an hour). About once a year, I screw up, and a request expires without my response. In the past, the consequences were that those dates on your calendar are marked as unavailable - *but you used to be able to manually unblock them on your calendar.*  

The past 3 times this has happened, I always did the same thing - respond immediately apologizing for my lateness, unblock my calendar dates the guest had requested, and sent the guest a special offer for 15% off and a note saying ""if you are still looking for a place to book, you can book me at a discount to make up for my tardy reply!"" 2 out of 3 times, the guest booked with me, and was happy. the other person had made alternate arrangements, but sent a message thanking me for the offer and asking if they could take me up on the discount if they booked with me on a subsequent trip (sure thing). 

On Easter, I screwed up again. I was distracted, with family, traveling, or in a ham coma. Just my luck, i missed a reservation request in the festivities.

**Now, when you let a reservation request expire, the requested dates are *permanently blocked* on your calendar, and can *never* be unblocked.**

I completely understand the point of the rule change is to communicate that it's really not ok to leave a request hanging. I'm nonetheless a little sad, because it took away the steps i could take wth guests to try to give them a better experience. 

**Airbnb, if you read these forums, you should change the system to block those date for ALL OTHER REQUESTS, but still allow the host to send the requesting guest a special offer. that way you keep the punitive aspect of leaving guests hanging, but still allow the hosts to reach out to these guests to try to ""make it right.""** 

i'm really really glad i discovered this on a 2-day request, instead of a 1-month request. that would have been catastrophic.

Entire home (apartment). No issues. The night before checkout they ask if they can leave bags and collect them at 4pm (5 hours after check-out) because their flight is not until evening. I know that they have large backpacks etc...so I say OK. I don't have a booking coming in the next day, but I do have instant book on so that could change.

I arrange for the cleaner to do the bedrooms but NOT the kitchen/bathroom, instead go and clean my other Airbnb (close by) and come back after 4pm to finish up.

*Note: all of these items are either in plain sight or the location was detailed in the check-in sheet every guest has in their room. Also, I had already told her when she made the reservation that she is welcome to make herself at home in the kitchen and put her things where she pleases.*

>I have checked out and will not be returning. Thank you for your hospitality

I respond with

>Okay, thank you for letting me know! I certainly hope it wasn't anything wrong with the house causing you to leave early?

And I get no response. I am a major clean freak and I do the turnovers myself, I am at the house topping things up and wiping things down literally every day and I have 79 five star reviews reflecting the effort I put into keeping up the cleanliness of my Airbnb house. So when I get no response explaining why she left, I just chalk it up to the guest having a personal issue and needing to leave early for whatever reason.

The next day she messages 

>are you going to refund the [amount] you charged to my card

I say 

>Hi Shirley! You'll need to cancel the reservation via your Airbnb app or by calling Airbnb at [number.] as per my moderate cancellation policy you are entitled to a 50% refund for the remaining days of your stay. Also, I know it's your first time using Airbnb so I just wanted to let you know that should you have any issues requiring you to leave a booking early then you definitely need to make sure the reservation is cancelled or altered or you may not receive the refund you're looking for.

She responds

>ok sorry my friend showed me Airbnb but I get it now 

Great! All sorted. Or so I think.

This morning I get another message from her. I notice the reservation is *still* in place, but ends today. Her message says

>REBEKAH, when are you going to refund me!!!!! Do it  NOW!!!

My full name is actually Rebekah but my Airbnb name just says Bekah. Is this woman really using my full name like a parent admonishes a child? I respond with

>Hi Shirley, as I told you before you will need to get in touch with Airbnb to sort out a cancellation. I cannot cancel a reservation on my end without repercussions including the revocation of my Superhost status. 

Then I get an email saying a resolution case has been opened. Ooh boy, her description was filled with capital letters and excessive exclamation points. Claiming the room was filthy, the bathroom was disgusting, the roommates were too loud, and that I had completely ignored her many and repeated complaints and then never guided her on how to cancel the reservation. She continued on that I was clearly trying to sabotage her and steal her money and that I was a ""rude entitled LITTLE LADY"" 

I call Airbnb myself and the CSR quickly reads over her resolution claim and the message thread, then laughs out loud and says ""I guess she didn't think we would read her messages..."" because the messages *clearly* indicate that she is being wildly dishonest. 

He tells me that ""at this point her reservation has ended and she is claiming a refund based on what seem to be invalid complaints.

When they arrived yesterday and made the self check in at the allowed time (with a code) they realized the apartment was a mess since the last guest checked out and nobody cared to change sheets and towels. Obviously the bathroom was dirty. I kept in touch with the host, she was sorry and said she would send someone to bring clean sheets, towels and to clean the apartment. I had to take the flight to stockholm so I just gave the first couple the contact info of the host. When our airplane landed at midnight we discovered that nobody had come to clean the apartment and they only brought 2 towels out of 4. We tried to contact the host again byut she wouldn't reply any more. Obviously we had no chance but to sleep in the apartment since it was late. What should we do?

Today I got a different booking request for the same dates and two guests. Her opening message was that she said she needed a place to stay before moving into an apartment. So I accepted and asked when they expected to arrive. She responded that her sister and law Karen and son would be arriving at whatever time.

In this case, the reservation is still covered by Host Guarantee and Host protection policies.

We never actually met our host, as she had us check in with someone at a neighboring restaurant to get the key. 

The pictures and the description explained that there was a pool for the whole apartment building and WiFi. When we arrived, the views were to die for, but other things were just “off”. For example, the bed had a sheet on it and pillows, but all towels and other sheets were hanging on a drying rack in the living room. The pool was green and stagnant, and didn’t look like it had been opened in a few months. I understand that some pools are seasonal, but I feel like it shouldn’t be promoted if it isn’t open, or at least a note in the description describing that the pool isn’t currently available. 

The WiFi also didn’t work. The password worked but the internet connection was nonexistent. We ended up having to use data on our phones. We restarted the WiFi a few times, with no luck. 
We messaged our host as soon as we realized it wasn’t working (Friday evening). We didn’t hear back from her until Sunday morning, as we were leaving the apartment. She said “the WiFi has never had problems before. I’ll get someone to look at it on Monday. Hope you enjoyed your stay!”

Welp, pretty much got the worst case scenario. Even though I had only had her property booked for 5 minutes, she chose not to refund me anything. I tried to explain to her that the reason I couldn’t just change the dates was because I didn’t have a couple hundred extra dollars to front (the correct dates were in peak season so more than I paid originally) and that I had spent all summer saving this money and with no refund or credit, I don’t have enough to book something else. I’m just a college student so this money took me a long time to save.

Even though it was my mistake, I was hoping she would be understanding and even if she didn’t refund me the whole $700 maybe just 50 or 25% for my technical error.

adb16de4-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Dear Hosts,","When property damages happen, you will be directed by Airbnb to submit a claim through their Resolution Center page. 

Before doing so, here are some tips that may save you a couple of emails back and forth with your case manager. 

1. When you find the damages, report it right away to your guest (in Airbnb messaging system) or to Airbnb (via call or message) so you don't miss the submission deadline. It is strictly within 24H of your next G's check-in, or within 14 days of their check-out. 

2. Be always sure to take photos or videos of the damage. Without a photo, unless your guest admits to have caused the damage, it would take longer to process your request (unless Airbnb decides to resolve the issue by paying for it). Adding a replacement invoice or link works too, but the priority here is that you submit this request on time. 

3. Unless it is bat-shit crazy cleaning issue, if you have done the cleaning yourself and you are requesting for reimbursement for your extra time spent cleaning, it will most likely be denied by your case managers. 

Most general cleaning gets denied from Trust and Safety, because they mainly deal with property damages, and not cleaning/extra guests/other additional fees. 

To increase the chances of getting reimbursed for your claim, choosing the correct option when filing a Resolution Center saves some time:

1) If your main concern is additional cleaning/additional guest/extra services, choose the ""Extra Services/Other Trip related issues"" option when filing in resolution center. 

2) If your main concern is property damages, choose the ""Damaged or missing items"" option. 

- If your concerns are 50% property damages and 50% additional cleaning/guests/services, file it under other Extra Services or Trip related issues. 

Because 1) is handled by Trip case managers and 2) is handled by Trust and Safety case managers. In cases with mixed issues, most of the time, Trip case managers toss the property damages to Trust and safety, and handle the cleaning issue themselves.

Just note that sometimes you will get unlucky and get ahold of a lazy (or confused, or new, or idk stupid) Trip case manager for your claim, they will toss the entire claim and Trust and Safety just denies the additional cleaning and etc.

4. Once the Resolution Center request gets submitted, your guest is notified via email about your claim. They have 72 hours to accept or decline your request. Should they not respond in 72H (or decline your request), you can choose to involve Airbnb to mediate the claim. 

If you do not press the involve Airbnb button, no one will proactively reach out to you about it unless you mention about it. 

So press that Involve Airbnb button so a case manager reaches out to you.

All of them agreed in writing to follow my house rules.

In each of the circumstances (less than a dozen), I contacted Airbnb support immediately, before reviews were posted, and uploaded photos, usually over eight of them. Sometimes these involved obvious damage, sometimes it was whatever I could come up with to show that someone was smoking (today I found cigars in the kitchen trash can, for example), or otherwise trashed the house but didn't break anything.

After reviews were posted, I followed up with a request to the guest for compensation. This ranged from an additional cleaning fee to cleaning fee + paint supplies, all the way down to like $20 for broken glasses and ruined towels. None of these requests ever totaled over $300.

So, to the main point - in each and every single one of these instances, AirBnb has consistently shown that they don't have my back as a host, at all. In fact, I have never once gotten any money from the *deposit I collect specifically to cover damages*, even with photos. 

Given that my bookings are good, I don't see any benefit to allowing instant book. I have a good idea of the type of person I want in my house (and no, it doesn't violate any of Airbnb's discrimination policies), and starting today anyone outside that will be declined. I've had enough of the total lack of support from this company. Just to make sure in case my bookings drop off, I signed up for VRBO, something I've been resisting doing for a long time.

adb17cc6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Guest hell: harassing, sexual guest will not stop","I usually rent out just my guest room while I am home. On occasion, I'll rent out my whole house for a weekend or so. I've been doing this for over a year and have never had any issues with guests. Before having this home, I rented my entire Chicago condo out on the regular with no issue ever.

Then, I rented my house to a guest for 2 weeks while I was on vacation. Here's a summary of what I found upon returning home:

-  Guest left male sex toy ""HotOctopuss"" on master dresser. In the drawer beneath the sex toy, the guest stored one of my pink Mongolian fur pillows from West Elm with a hole cut out of it (the size of a sand dollar, approximately). Guest insists this was from his dog ""attacking"" the pillow, though scissor marks are obvious. Due to his excuse and the pillow's proximity to the sex toy, it seems possible that this was used as a sex toy. Also, since submitting my claim for damages, guest is insistent on taking ownership of the damaged item. Ew.

- Guest says there's no way the pillow he cut a hole in could possibly be the $100 pillow from West Elm I linked to (and showed the tags for) because ""no one with polyester sheets would own $100 pillows... yes I checked."" Sorry dude, I just like anti-wrinkle sheets.

- Guest said he had a 30lb, older dog that is well beyond its teething phase. I told guest from the get-go that pets that cause damage are not welcome, but he insisted his pets were well-behaved. My cleaning lady (who has been cleaning my small house for a year) walked in and immediately saw shreds of the rug scattered around the dining room by the shredded rug. Guest insists his dog didnt do it.

- Guest insists I show video of the dog ripping the carpet up since I ""obviously record everything inside the house."" I have 1 camera inside the house facing the front door and side door. The camera is triggered by the ADT alarm going off, which I explained to the guest. He didn't cover it or unplug it at any time.

- I tell the guest ""all communications will occur through airbnb"" Despite this, guest continues to send harassing messages. 

I tried to resolve this with the guest from Day 1. I simply stated the damage, cost to replace, and offered to even send his photos and sex toy back. He was not reasonable and insisted he did none of the damage. So, I submitted an Airbnb claim over a week ago. Then he went BALLISTIC messaging me trying to disprove every element of my claim.

I have heard nothing from Airbnb. I continue to be harassed by the guest. He wants to come back and ""verify"" my claims and ""take possession"" of the damaged items.

Airbnb reps have told me they see this going my way when I call them to inquire on the status. However, there is still no resolution and they said I cannot block the guest from messaging me until the claim is complete.

This is ridic. I just wanted to post this in hopes of some community support. I know this isn't the norm; it certainly hasn't been in my experience. This is has been so wild I just had to share.

adb17f96-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"We (hosts) need a code word for ""persnickety""","(Sorry for the rant) 

Here is my thinking. 

Having hosted about 100 times now, most of my experiences have been just fine. However there have been guests who have been very needy and generally impossible to please. For example, those who complain about ""location"" or ""transit"" when they could have just looked at the map to know where they are and how far by bus to get where they want to go daily etc... As with another recent post, if you book my place, then you should realize where it is in relation to where you want to go. Don't book it if its not convenient enough for you. And I don't control traffic or rush hour. 

Another one that has come up is people complaining about the size of the space. It is WELL DOCUMENTED in the listing exactly how much space the location has. As well as about 20 pictures to look at. C'mon people. Read the entire listing before you book. 

When dealing with these finicky guests, I have found it to be unsettling. I leave them an imperfect review and go back later to read their public comments (below my review) where they trash me for calling them out on their neediness and inability to read the original description etc. It angers me - maybe more than it should. 

The only reason that I leave a less-than-perfect guest review is to warn other hosts before they accept a request from the same guest. I don't do it for myself as I would probably never re-host this person anyway. So I'm just doing it for the good of the hosting community. But there is always some blow-back, even if its just the negative feeling that the entire experience leaves me with. 

So, if there was only a code word that we could insert into a short review that is not in itself negative or slanderous BUT that other hosts would recognize as meaning that the guest was finicky/pushy/needy/persnickety/unpleasable or one of those who books without reading the entire listing only to then complain about things that are clearly documented. 

Thoughts?

Haha, maybe ""WSFHT"" (well suited for hotel travel) could be a start. 

TLDR - code word for hosts to use in guest reviews so that other hosts are warned that this guest is finicky and probably best suited for hotel travel.",0.89,29,1505157334.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/6zhlfb/we_hosts_need_a_code_word_for_persnickety/,True,26

adb18694-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Sidebar info for guests,"Based on community suggestion we will split the sidebar into two sections, one for guests, and one for hosts. We should also put the Airbnb US phone number on the side.

Info for guests:

1) Reviews are golden. See how your host has reviewed the guests, as well, to see how picky they are. Reviews can only be made after a verified trip, so they really are golden on Airbnb

2) In an emergency situation (i.e. foreign country with no way to contact the host and they are late) contact Airbnb FIRST, not AFTER Reddit. Reddit can advice, Airbnb can do.

3) Verify yourself as much as possible. Hosts do not get to see the verifications you upload, but they instill a lot of confidence if you have validated with a driving license, for example.

4) When sending a booking request, please add a reasonable amount of detail whilst not coming across as needy. You want to personalise your message to show that you have read the listing and dont ask questions that are answered in it

5) Communicate with your hosts before you go, and make sure they know when you are arriving and when you are leaving

6) Whilst Airbnb itself may be a business, do not treat rooms as hotels, but rather, as a paying guest in someone's home. Many Airbnb hosts live in the place they list, and making sure they (and you) are comfortable is the most important thing mutually.

7) **Airbnb reviews are not for the benefit of the host, they are for the benefit of their future guests! Review fairly, but honestly.**

8) **DO NOT EXCHANGE MONEY OFF THE AIRBNB PLATFORM. IT IS AGAINST PLATFORM RULES. ANY HOST WHO TRIES TO DO THIS, SHOULD BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY**",0.98,28,1454149872.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/43dlv3/sidebar_info_for_guests/,True,8

“Good afternoon, 

My name is [Some Lady], and I'm an American writer, but have been living in Europe for over 15 years.  I've recently started a new website wherein my goal is to promote interesting and unique places around the world, including hotels, restaurants, wine cellars, etc., to tourists abroad. I try to focus on establishments that are particularly unique in styIe, and that people from abroad don't know that much about, but would like an up close and personal (virtual) experience before making the decision to go or stay there themselves.  I will be in Dallas at the beginning of December and I was wondering if you would be interested in collaborating with me on my project. 

In exchange for a complimentary stay for 2 at your place (which I would document), I would be giving your business exposure on my website with photos, video and an article. 

As I live in Europe, my readership is fairly wide.  I have been successful in promoting nearly 200 businesses in just over a year, having done promotional work in 7 countries.  Most recently traveling throughout the countries of Greece, all of Portugal and all of Italy. 

Please find below the link to my website, and don't hesitate to get in touch with me at any time. 

 

I appreciate your time and attention and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

 

Sincerely, 

 

[Some Lady]”


So obviously the general response to these types of requests is basically “lol NEXT!”, but I’m sort of perversely curious here.  Should I let her stay for free and pay me with her sweet sweet words and smartphone pics?  I’m genuinely curious if any hosts have actually done it before and how it went (were they good guests, did the ‘exposure’ actually do anything for them, etc.)

Additional context:  It is a two bedroom apartment in an extremely desirable part of town - lots of restaurants and hotel conventions within walking distance, and very few listings of any kind within a two-mile radius of us, let alone that offer ‘entire place’ accommodations.  She’s requesting three nights that would normally pay me out $283 USD; someone else requested one of the nights she wants right before she did, so if I went down this road at all I could only give her two (non-weekend) nights.

I’m a Superhost and the listing has 250+ reviews, but we’re shutting it down soon and I’m not strapped for the cash - but also not an idiot and not looking to get taken advantage of, and certainly not looking to get the place trashed.

I guess it just depends on who you speak with and the effort they are willing to make.

A recent guest smoked cigs in my apartment. And the maids invoiced me $200 for the smoke damage to return the apartment to its original state.  I have provided the invoice and images of the cig butts found in the apt to Airbnb.

When I went to message the guest and make the damage deposit request, I found out that Airbnb had since removed the guest’s account for “violation of terms”, meaning I had no way to contact them (phone number and email are also removed).

I made the claim with Airbnb directly and they denied responsibility.

Personally I find it a little bit insulting and secondly I blame Airbnb that still hasn’t made clear to guests on how Airbnb Experiences work. People come with odd requests like “I want a private photo shoot can I pay for one person?” Or “ we are a couple we won’t need more photos of each other, just the two of us” 


What should I do? Firstly I am thinking I don’t want to mess up with kids (that’s why I had it off since the beginning). Second is to tell her that she has to pay at least for two people (he and her husband).

The bad actors are also the ones who get local governments to pass ordinances restricting Airbnb rentals. It would be easy for Airbnb to remove listings without business licences in cities that require them. It would be easy to scan for and take down a lot of illegal listings. But instead of supporting legal hosts, Airbnb spends their time and money fighting to keep illegal (and sometimes unsafe!) listings up (e.g. the Paris lawsuit, the France hotels lawsuit, the June changes to the website for New Orleans listings).

Host treated me like a child, raised her voice at me due to miscommunications (language barriers) and the listing was not completely accurate.

Most of the comments I left for the host were in the confidential section while I left a factual and honest, and not that harsh public review.

""House is very clean and well equipped. Safe location with walking trails nearby and a large supermarket and small mall in short walking distance. House is well lit and rather spacious. Nantes centre ville is 30-45 minutes by foot, otherwise easily accessible by a bus and tram or by bike. Listed as entire house but is instead a private bedroom with access to all household amenities. House is shared with owner, and occasionally other AirBnB users in another private bedroom. Pet rabbit on property (important for those with allergies). Me and my friend felt a bit “mothered” by the host rather than as guests.""

Private comments pertained to a neighbour who always looked into the upstairs bedroom window even though he knew we were always in there, to the inappropriateness of her tone of voice when speaking to me and unnecessary comments made about my capacity to complete a task eg. ""didn't your mother ever teach you this?"", smoking indoors (not even a complaint, just that it should be listed in the ad or discussed on arrival).

Within minutes of submitting the review, I received the following email sent to my private email address which I gave her for a completely unrelated reason.

(Has been translated to the best of my ability)

""Good evening,

I hope you like your job.

I did not know you were working for the airbnb site!

I hate people who make you think that everything is fine and who tell you things that are offensive to you because they do not dare to tell you what they think in front of you.

As my house is not a hotel excuse me for asking you to do some housework.

I also hate slackers

If you did not want to do a yoga class, you had to tell me that you just did not feel like it and did not tell me that you loved yoga.

I hope the rabbit did not create too much allergy.

Fortunately my children are less perverse and smarter than you.

THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE MANY WAYS ARE HYPOCRITES !!

Good luck in your new job and I hope that someday you will have enough money to buy a house without having to make a roommate.""

Neither yoga nor doing house work was once mentioned in my review or comments and seems completely unrelated (?).

Having anticipated this type of immature response, am I justified in having not complained directly to her face?  
I clearly specified in comments that all the things she does in her home are fine as long as she explains them in the listing...

At this point I have reported her listing in a general sense, but would like to submit this communication for review by AirBnB staff as I think this is totally inappropriate.

adb1aa20-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,After hosting for 1 year we finally had our first nightmare experience (lots of details in text),"We had a male (21) guest and his mother (40) stay with us in our spare bedroom (only a queen, no couch) in our house for 5 nights.    They were taking advantage of a discount we offered (10% off stays more than 3 days).  They said in their message they were a son and mother from the Bronx, NY and were in town sightseeing but they never left our house and were in their room the entire time.  They didn’t have a car and our house is not really walkable to anything unless you are willing to walk more than half a mile.  Besides being stangely absent even though they were in our house the entire time, they didn’t say or do anything that made me feel uncomfortable the first 3-4 days of their stay.  On the 4th day of their stay, I flew out to the other side of the country for a business trip and my fiance and our two guests were left in the house.  On the night before they were supposed to check out, they asked my fiance if they could stay another week and my fiance said no because we had guest booked with us for the next couple of days.  The next morning my fiance left for work and she assumed they would check out at some point during the day because our check out time is noon.  My fiance came home from work around 9 PM and was shocked to see the mother still there with all of her luggage.  Her “son” was gone.  The mother gave a million excuses why she hadn’t left yet one of them being she didn’t have enough money to get to where she was staying so she gave my finance the last $10 cash she had so my fiance could call what would end up being a $20 uber that my fiance paid for.  She also admitted to eating some of our sweet potatoes.  Not a big deal, but I kind of question the kind of person who steals sweet potatoes but fesses up when they need to ask for money for an uber and they don’t have the uber or lyft app on their phone.  After about 30 minutes the woman returns to our house with all of her bags and knocks on the door and starts screaming at my fiance (she is home alone downtown Atlanta) to let her in and to give her back $20 because “the address the uber took me to was wrong”.  At this point my fiance calls me back and says she has locked the doors and turned out all the lights and is pretending she isn’t home and is whispering into the phone.  At this time we immediately decide to call the police and they arrive shortly and talk to my fiance and the mother seperately and the police and the mother leave.  My fiance is super scared, but nothing else happens that night (its about midnight when the police leave.

Some things to note:

1. Even thought they said they were from the Bronx when I asked them where they were from, the mother told me she was from Trinidad and Tobego when we first met in person.  After all this happened, I looked more closely at her profile and it said she was from the city I live in.  My fiance and I very rarely accept people from our own city.  So that was one red flag I didn’t catch

2.  They didn’t have a car in a city and neighborhood our profile and commone sense says is necessary.  Not everyone has a car and I get that, but I’ve never met people without cars who don’t use uber/lyft/bike to get to and from our house.  Un

3.  They said they were here to sightsee, but they never left our house.  We also never saw them cook either and they were with us for 5 days.

4. I’m not sure they were truthful about the mother/son thing. I never saw the son even though he stayed with us for 5 days.  Also I feel a mother that young and man (21) wouldn’t sleep in the same queen bed.  We advertise that we have a spare mattress and a pull out bed in the living room in our listing

5.  Since they were a last minute request for 5 nights, I didn’t wait for my fiance to screen them and give me her ok.  She is a lot more skeptical than I am, and she would have said no.  In the future we will have to agree we want to host this person.

6.  Her son was somewhere else when all of this was happening.  He kept calling my cell phone over and over again but I didn’t want to talk to him outside a place wher airbnb could monitor our conversation. 

7.  Sweet potator thief.  

I filed a complaint the next day with airbnb but my gf accidentally left a review without telling me what she was doing.    

Here is the review that the son left

“Most Racist Host, They Even Called The Cops On Me For Leaving Slightly Later Than Check Out Time, And host Constantly Was Itching His Sack The Whole Time I Was There, Idk Whether He Got Crabs Or Not But Don’t Shake His Hand”

What should we do?  We are thinking about installing an electronic lock that we can reprogram the key to.  My fiance doesn’t want to really do it anymore either.

I've posted here before about guests wanting to use my property as free off-site parking for the nearby airport (most of our guests are catching flights, we're less than 10 minutes away from the main terminal). I'm not sure why they ask (well, duh, because they want to save money and don't stop to think), but they do. After several inquiries starting in November, I added language to the listing about how they cannot leave their cars here while they go cavort in Tahiti or whatever.

Of course, people don't read, or if they do, they misread. A recent guest did the latter a few days back, and thought we were saying that leaving cars here is a-ok. She put us in a spot but was paying twice our usual rate for a holiday time stay, so we caved and let her. And I set about further clarifying the language and adding MANY CAPITAL LETTER SENTENCES SAYING NO AIRPORT PARKING into the listing, both the short description and the main body text. Yesterday, I decided to mock up a ""no airport parking"" sign graphic and add that to the photos, because reading is hard and that way someone browsing just the pictures would get the message.

It's definitely the worst review I've ever received. I guess I might just be here to vent, but also kind of seeking advice on how to avoid this in the future. 

It was an older German lady traveling with her 18 year old son. The room, common areas and bathroom were cleaned by the same standard that they always are, which generally garners really positive reviews. A few minutes after arrival to her room, she demanded that the other bedroom on the floor (my bedroom), to which the door was closed and she entered without permission, was the one that she had booked. My room has NEVER been on airbnb and there aren't even any photos of it on the internet at all. We have another listing that is for a bigger room, I'm not sure if she got confused while booking, but we went over her reservation on my macbook together with her son there as well and verified that the room she booked was definitely the room in the pictures. 

Throughout their stay, the mother kept cleaning the bathroom after each time she used it. Went through an entire pack of those Clorox toilet wand brushes. Constantly left the front door unlocked when they would return home at night. They also ate a TON of food of mine and of other guests. However when they asked for things like extra blankets or a late checkout, I was totally accommodating. I sat down with them and gave them a bunch of recommendations of places to eat and things to do. 

I feel like I went above and beyond to be accommodating to them and that the low rating is totally unjustified. 

Aside from just swallowing the bad rating and hoping it doesnt happen again, what are some suggestions to avoid this in the future?

Side note, I'm never going to turn anyone away from my place (unless it seems like a fake booking which I've had issues with), but I've noticed a trend that the more problematic reviews come from older people, the 40+ aged guests mostly.

The IRS has specific publication regarding the 7 considerations to determine whether or not to classify your income as passive or active.  Below is a brief list of a few considerations to think about when determining your income classification:                

* Do you have any W-2 earnings or income beyond Airbnb in which you participate on a daily (or weekly basis)?  For example, if you determine that your income from Airbnb is active and you also have W-2 earnings, you can net the two sources of income together.  This can help lower your taxes. 
* If you decided to purchase furniture for your Airbnb rental, you may determine that you will want to deduct that expense from your Airbnb income.  If this creates a loss, will you then want to try to net this loss against gains in other income sources? This could potentially help reduce your overall taxes.
* Did you change jobs? Quit your job or get laid off?  For some people, this might be a nightmare, but from a tax perspective there can be some huge tax savings involved.  Its important to classify your Airbnb income appropriately to help lower your overall tax rate.

Overall, there are some serious tax savings available to you depending on how your classify your Airbnb income.

The table chairs were dirty, the kitchen equipment was dirty, all window sills in kitchen & bedrooms (near AC) were incredibly dirty, spider webs and dead baby spiders were present near kitchen entrance, & the place just looked dusty & unkept.

The place can be rented as a whole space or per private room (2 rooms). I don’t know how on earth it can be rented as private rooms when none of the doors lock (including the bathroom). One bedroom didn’t even have a door, it had a shutter/folding door that’s used for closets.

Now, the host‘s review: “Hosts Beware!” & he goes on say that we stayed for 8+ hours before asking for a refund, that we left with the key, that they had to contact customer support about it & get us out, that we pulled hair from brushed & left hair strands throughout the house, & that we left the place messy.

We knocked on the front door and no one answered except her dog. The house manual on the platform said that if no one was home we could go in through the back (unlocked door) and get settled. 

We did as we were told but upon entering we saw the entire place was upside down. Laundry scattered everywhere - on the bed we were supposed to sleep on, on the floor, everywhere. We called out her name and no one answered. 

Her dog came in the room barking, restless, and acting really strange. Then we saw that the door to her backyard had been left open. It was pouring rain when we arrived, water was coming in, and her laundry hanging on a clothesline outside was soaked. 

The whole situation seemed off, but it was my girlfriend who had to convince me that something was wrong. We left to call AirBnB from the car, but the dog ran out and I had to chase him down two blocks in the rain and bring him back into the apartment. 

AirBnB asked us to take a picture of the apartment as we found it, but we felt unsafe doing so. We had just walked into someone's home unannounced and found it abruptly abandoned. Anyone could've come into this place. What if something bad had happened to the host? We told them we were worried, and we were right. 

AirBnB found out our host had been rushed to the hospital, but they couldn't tell us why. They cancelled all the bookings for that place and told me they were going to take down the listing.  We got a full refund, a coupon, but ended up staying in the only available hotel last minute, which cost us an arm and a leg. 

Had we not called AirBnB and didn't think much of the situation, we would've stayed in this abandoned apartment that apparently anyone could walk into.",0.93,27,1568557655.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/d4l42z/creepiest_experience_ive_ever_had_with_airbnb/,True,9

Airbnb had the wrong location for the address of the listing I booked on their map (by about 30 min walking). The taxi took me to the address I gave him and it seemed further than it was supposed to but I had no cell data (just arrived in Kazakhstan). When I checked in with the host and I got WiFi I checked and it was considerably further from where I need to be for my planned month stay. I contacted Airbnb and they were confused (the address is also wrong on Google maps). Eventually I informed the host I couldn't stay as the location was really the only thing that mattered and it wouldn't work for me. Airbnb support didn't seem to quite understand or didn't believe me. Now I'm saying I want a refund and I believe the host should also be compensated in some form.  Support said well we probably won't be able to refund you and you should just go back there. The person handling my case also added he/she was going on vacation and wouldn't be able to help for a while. The actual listing location is useless  to me and this situation is entirely airbnbs fault. The host provided the correct address and I based my decision to book off of airbnbs incorrect map. I'm not entirely sure how to proceed but I'm being treated like there's not really a problem.

I should add there are currently no other airbnbs available for even remotely the same price or within the area I need to be. 

They gave me a Russian number to call for support but it didn't work as I'm not in Russia. A relative is helping me contact their US help line but it's all ongoing with very little progress.

Any ideas on what I should do next would be greatly appreciated.

They brought 6 more people than allowed, brought a dog and we don't allow pets, left a ton of trash everywhere, and were 40 minutes late checking out. Our cleaning team waited for them to leave and witnessed the extra people and dog.

We requested a small portion of their deposit to cover extra trash pickup (this is listed in our manual) and a deeper clean for bringing a dog, because I'm allergic.

They denied it, so we went through Airbnb. Airbnb sided with us after we sent them pictures for proof, and got us the requested money.

The guests then left the worst review ever claiming that the cabin was filthy with spiderwebs (not true), the carpet was so dirty and gross that they had to put down towels just to walk on it (the carpet is only two months old and definitely not gross or dirty), there is mold in the dressers, so they couldn't put their clothes in there (not true), and that her kids had such bad bedbug bites that they had to go to a doctor (absolutely not true).

Along with them giving us only 1 star, this is obviously the worst review a new host could have. Bedbugs, spiderwebs and mold scares people.

We wrote a response explaining that these things are not true and that they are retaliating, because we requested their deposit. We're worried this may not be enough, even though all our other reviews (6) have been very positive.

Airbnb has been arguing with us for days saying that they can't take the review down, because it doesn't violate any of their rules. I guess we feel that a lie claiming that someone has bedbugs is pretty serious. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Would this be considered slander? Could we get an exterminator to prove that we don't have bedbugs and submit that to Airbnb?

We host a space that's a brand new private apartment in the lower unit of our home with a separate entrance, fully equipped and stocked kitchen and laundry room.  We're Superhosts with mostly 5-star reviews and some 4's mixed in.  Today we got our first 3-star review from a guest who complained that we were extremely noisy late into the night to the point of being disruptive and that the smell of cigarette and marijuana smoke was constantly wafting down into the unit and ruining their stay.  They also complained about a number of missing amenities, none of which are marked as available amenities in the listing - it was more of a wishlist of things they would like to have included.  The overall tone of the review was quite bad, in addition to the 3-star rating. 

&#x200B;

Normally I respond to negative feedback (if it warrants it) but I'm seriously at a loss as to what to even say to this one.  Certainly those points would warrant a bad review but I just don't understand what he was experiencing.  We're a  professional couple in our 30s who go to bed every night between 10 and 11 and get up early to go to work.  We don't drink or go out, so we never come home late and we never deviate from our routine.  Even on the weekends, we go to bed early and get up early to go to the gym.  Aside from walking around barefoot in our own home, I can't imagine what he was hearing and in fact this same guest roused us out of bed one night by banging on the interior door for 20 minutes because he couldn't figure out how to access the WiFi info in the app or how to use the volume on the TV remote.  We don't smoke cigarettes or marijuana and  after recently hosting smokers I am crazy about airing out the unit and our own house so no smells linger.  Despite his idiotic midnight tantrum we didn't have any negative interactions with him so I can't imagine he would feel the need to make things up.  Does he expect that I not live in my own home while he's here because the sound of two people talking at 8 pm is just too egregious?  Wtf?

adb1d888-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Got a bad guest review as a newbie,"Just come back from my first stay in an Airbnb and received the following review:

""relations pleasant but the apartment was left in a very dirty state""

We were charged nearly £40 as a cleaning fee as part of the original reservation so our assumption is that this would cover cleaning the one bed apartment at the end of the stay. This was our first AirBnB stay

We stayed a week, and didn't clean the bathroom during that time so it would have needed cleaning. We left some salad stuff pate and cheese in the fridge, but it hadn't gone off and there was food in the fridge when we arrived anyway. We wiped the kitchen surfaces down but didn't do a deep clean. We didn't vacuum the floors either. We did strip the bedding and place it with towels into the laundry basket as requested and we also took out the trash.

Now when I look back at their policies I see:

""Also, for everyone to enjoy their holiday in peace, you are asked travelers to leave the apartment clean and tidy.""

This also frustrating because the balcony flooded while we were there since the drain holes were blocked with concrete and this meant we were mopping the living room floor with towels at 4.30am, and also had to spend nearly a whole morning waiting for builders to come and fix it a couple of days later. We didn't make a major issue of this in our review but I wish I had done. Had I known that I would be expected to clean up after the builders I would have complained that they had left mess on the balcony.


Is this the first stage of being shaken down for extra cleaning costs? What is the cleaning fee for if it isn't for cleaning?

Should I make some sort of response or will this make matters worse?

A guy and his wife coming from asia to work in the city for two years. They have a working permit (as he told me). They are waiting for a condo near their work space so they have been staying for a month in another room and now they are looking for another one. 

We said we would not be comfortable for a stay longer than 26 day (what he actually asked for in the first place) but we would welcome him for this month.

The next day, he calls my boyfriend, overwhelmingly friendly (we are introvert nerds, so many things can be overly friendly for us) to say he will be really happy to come stay with us bla bla bla. My bf redirect him to Airbnb to communicate with me. He sends me a mail telling me how we will have a great time and that he hope we will be friend bla bla bla...A bit intense for me. Anyway, since we were three weeks from the actual check-in at noon, I told him to come back to me the day before to confirm the check-in.

Nothing from then. 
I should have poke him yesterday, but I did not as I was sick and went to bed early. 

They arrived at 8 AM. He was there, with an enormous amount of luggage on the streets, pressing my doorbell vehemently. I woke up, confused. At the same time, the phone rang. It was my bf, apparently, the guest called him to know whats up.

I opened the door, in pyjama, and told him that the check-in was at noon. THe room isnt ready (plus, its very rude to wake me up. I could have been at work too!).

He told me that he was busy at work and didnt have the time to write to me (wow! so much bullshit!). He had to go get his wife with the second half of the luggage. He leaves. 

I'm feeling really unconfortable with all that. I'm really uptight about respect and I don't know if it is a cultural shock or something but anyway. I write to him on bnb this : 

Hi ___,

We would have liked an update for your check-in and nor arrive 4h early. We are welcoming you in our home and, as we will respect your space and time, we would like the same.

Immediate flow of answers : We are sorry and regrette of not informing// total my mistake //but thank you for being a understanding host// just that we are in bit bad time for now//We will not give any further chance to complain and will adhere to the rules.

He is back after 10 minutes. He tries to open the door without a knock or a ring. I open it. His wife does not ackowledge me. SHe does not look at me. THey just rush the luggage in. I try to engage with the wife. I say hi, she stops, finally turns back to me and I shake his hand. She apologies. I help them with the luggage and tell them I'll show them around.

The guy says ''but we don't have the time for that''. 

For me that is very rude, and I don't care. I show her wife around the house for the kitchen. He took the key for the room. I regret not removing the key on the table.

The guy told me that they are here for two years in my city. In fact, they may have to use the room for an extended stay (hm...we already agree you could not...).

Anyway, they leave for work. It's 9h30 AM. The official check-in is a 11h AM and I really want to cancel. I do not feel confortable with those guests. 

I try to not be a bitch and see this from their perspective, but at the same time, I don't want to deal with their drama. THey already appear as a source of stress to me, but it is based on one event and a bad first impression.

adb1db6c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Host says he's deleting his AirBnB account during my stay. Not sure what to do.,"So I booked a place for 90 days and have been already here for 15 days. For various reasons, I ended up changing my reservation to only 45 days, which means I still have 30 days left at the current place. Today I received a message from the host (via WhatsApp) saying that I have the right to change it and it's OK if AirBnB allows it, but also that he's not happy with AirBnB and that he's canceling his account, and thus ( if I understand correctly from reading the FAQs @ airbnb) canceling any active and future reservations, which would imply I'd need to leave the place right after being notified of the cancelation, right?

As this is a long-term stay, I was already charged for the first month. I guess AirBnB will be issuing a refund or something similar, but I'm more worried about the host canceling the reservation while I'm not in the city, as I'm leaving for a long weekend soon, so nobody is gonna be taking care of my stuff.

&#x200B;

What happens if he cancels and I'm not here to take out my stuff? Does he still gets the money I already paid for the rest of the month?

&#x200B;

This sucks as I'm with my wife and kids, and I don't know for sure when he's gonna cancel and thus having to be on the look for an hotel or another airbnb. Also, I don't want to just book a new place and cancel it myself since I would be losing a lot of money on cancelation fees.

Any advice?

UPDATE: Talked with host, says he's closing his account in a couple of days but he offered to rent me the place for the remaining days of the reservation, although I'd need to pay him either cash or bank transaction, since he's not waiting for the reservation on AirBnB to end. He also mentioned we'll need to update our written contract (when I first got here we signed a paper contract since the city requires it) to reflect the new dates/price, etc. Seems like my options are either trust him and do it with no airbnb involved, or to stay a couple of nights at an hotel while I get a new place at airbnb (already looked up and they're more expensive since it needs to be at least 32 days for most long-term pricing).",0.88,26,1537226193.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/9gpddh/host_says_hes_deleting_his_airbnb_account_during/,True,23

adb1debe-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,AirBNB resolution center is a joke,"Similar to many other postings on Reddit, I recently had a terrible experience with AirBNB.

The condition of the rental unit was very different from the advertisement on AirBNB.  It was so bad that I spent the only 30 minutes inside the unit looking for a replacement hotel room.

I contacted AirBNB support to complain about the reservation and look for a refund.  As many users already know the burden of proof is on the renter, the actual customer of the service.  I was able to finally get a partial refund from AirBNB directly and they suggested I utilize the resolution center to try and collect a refund on the additional rental costs directly from the host.

There is an option in the resolution center where if the host and guest can not reach a decision that the user can request AirBNB to get involved and make a decision for both parties.  So again I opened a resolution case, again had to detail out all of the issues and provide photo evidence.  After the host did not respond to my request at all I involved AirBNB, and then I waited.  

After over 2 weeks without a response from anyone I reached out to AirBNB.   Only then did AirBNB reach out to the host on the open dispute, the host said they did not want to provide a refund and so AirBNB’s decision on the case was a verbatim reply of the hosts response.   The host did not have to provide any evidence, it was simply a one sentence response.

After pleading my case with AirBNB they told me since I reached out to AirBNB after ‘checking out’ from the unit there was nothing they could do.

I contacted Airbnb support but of course they are totally useless. They didn't even read my ticket and just gave me a copy/paste answer about refunding the guest. Why the fuck would I want to refund the guest after they done this shit.

The guest was a family of 3 with a 13 year old kid.

Since then, I called Airbnb and opened a case.  The case worker apparently talked to her and she claimed she had a head injury that made it difficult for her to remember my rules.  This all happened while I was at work.  This was a Thursday. When I got home, she seemed like she had turned over a new leaf.  About an hour later, I said ""hey by the way you left your shopping bags on the floor in the foyer"" and she said ""yeah I want to leave them there for my convenience.""  I told her she should pick them up because it's not an appropriate place to leave shopping bags aaaaand she started yelling about being a hotel guest and this is not a landlord situation or something.  So I let her settle down, then I told her I was shortening the reservation.  The next day I stayed home and she accepted the shortened reservation (Yay!) to be shortened to Sunday.

On Friday I went to bed, slept, and the next day I relaxed around the house for a few hours then went to see my gf and her dog.  While we were walking the dog, I get a voicemail that my guest called the cops while I was asleep (to talk about a personal matter) and they ended up committing her to the hospital.  So while I was asleep, she invited the cops into my house and they decided she should be committed.

Now, she's ""voluntarily"" committed and can't find her phone, and her commitment will last longer than the newly shortened reservation, and she doesn't have access to a device that will allow her to accept the change.  She said something about going to the library after she gets out.  I went ahead and updated the reservation to last until Tuesday but who knows if she'll accept.

TL;DR; shortened her stay, she called the cops ""about a personal matter"" and they committed her to an insane asylum.  She will be there until after her reservation ends, even though her stuff is still at my house.",0.93,26,1528638580.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8q0wc9/update_to_how_bad_of_a_knock_is_it_to_get_rid_of/,True,5

Rented an Airbnb, a condo, for my brothers graduation. Its a family vacation. 

Arrived at the place and the garage door is broken. Told the host. Host told is to manually open the door. Couldnt do it even with neighbor's help. Told the host. 

Host calls us and tells us that he will call a handyman and that the garage door is an ongoing issue and they just got it fixed. He told us we can park on the street so thats what we did. 

Walked to a restaurant to pick up dinner. Gone for maybe an hour. Come to find our car was towed for not having a pass. This information was not relaed to us. Also, We still had to pick up my brother from the airport. 

Had to get an uber to towing place and pay 300 bucks. On our way to get my brother from the airport. 

Now we are worried that our car will get towed again if we even find a parking spot. Told the host. Now the host is saying that hes actually not the host and is just managing the bnb and that he cant get a hold of the actual owners and that he too is out of town. 

I feel like they are lying to us. 

I paid 648 for the bnb, 15 for the uber to get to the towing place and 305 to release our car. Went through the app and its saying that I can only request 548. 

I want to get reimbursed for the whole trip. How do I go about doing this?

We specifically picked this bnb for the garage. We had to haul my brothers stuff from his apartment. Now i had to pay an extra 300 bucks just to get my car.

They said that they needed a late checkout as they were going out at 07:00 and didn't want to take their bags with them, but would be coming back later to collect them.

I said that leaving their bags here would be fine, but told them that they would have to leave their things downstairs, the guest bedroom unlocked and leave the keys behind.

They left this morning with all of their belongings locked inside the bedroom and they also took the keys with them.

The bedroom is not an issue as I have a spare key and will be moving everything downstairs if they aren't back by check out time.

Two of the keys are not an issue as I will duplicate these and charge the guest.

Unfortunately the third key cannot be duplicated and I cannot get a replacement until June. This key is used to access the building amenities, which our guest arriving today has booked specifically to use.

I phoned Airbnb and they told me that, if last night's guest hasn't returned the keys and the new guest wants to cancel I will be penalised for not providing the amenities detailed in my listing.

Anyways, they were great up until yesterday morning where they weren't answering my messages. They then messaged me ten minutes before checkout saying they just want to leave the key with the front desk and I said no just leave it on the counter.
  
When i got there, there was puke all over beside my bed, that they had attempted to clean up, and the place reeked of smoke. I aired the place out for the smoke but the puke was overwhelming so I have a cleaning company coming today to deep clean the carpets. I charged the guest 113 for the clean up and included a ton of photos. They also threw my towels out that they used to try and clean. I included photos of that as well.

So my host went out with some friends and they came back to the apartment at midnight. I was already in bed at this time and didn't fall asleep until around 4am. They were in the living room with the door closed but it did nothing at all for me. Around 2:30am, a neighbor rang the doorbell and my host went at it with her for about ten minutes. I wasn't planning to ask him and his friends to please keep it down and his conversation with this older woman made me feel so bad! He interrupted her while she was speaking, told her to not ruin his night, threw in some cuss words and some other things. Poor lady. 

I had only four hours of sleep cus this morning one of the shuffling of his friends woke me up. I'm honestly kind of annoyed because I paid $$ to stay two nights with a super host with good reviews and I feel like he was inconsiderate of me. That, or I'm a party pooper with a bad attitude.

adb1edbe-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Roommate Airbnbing Room,"I'm looking to get everyone's opinions on a rather unfortunate and awkward situation. My roommate had just told me that she will be Airbnbing out her bedroom for a month, starting in one week. She had never asked me if it was okay previously. I know she's going away for a month, and it would suck to pay for a place you're not living in, but I feel like I would be suffering because I would have to live with different strangers every night.

After doing some research, I thought it would be reasonable to ask for a cut of the profits (a cut of the amount over what her rent is). Curiously, I checked Airbnb, found the listing, and she listed for such a low price she's barely making any profit. Even if she were to give me half of the profit, I'd only be getting ~$300. I would rather not live with random people for a month than just get $300.

Additionally, all of the furniture in our living room - the couch, the shelves, the TV - are all mine, which she listed as a common space. In fact, she even listed my couch as a place where someone could sleep. Furthermore, she said in the listing that the guests could feel free to ask me if they needed anything.

To add insult to injury, we live in NYC, I checked our lease, and subletting is not allowed without prior written landlord consent, which she definitely does not have.

This situation is awkward because we're good friends. It would suck for her to have to pay for a room she's not living in, but part of me thinks that that's her problem because she signed a year-long lease, and that I should not have to suffer because she wants to go home for a month. I know I should tell her that I don't want her to Airbnb the place, but I need to do so in a way that preserves our already somewhat-strained friendship. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

UPDATE: my roommate has been avoiding me since I told her we need to talk about Airbnb. She stayed at her boyfriend’s place last night and never came home to talk. She must know that she’s being shitty. I’m making it clear that we have to talk TODAY.

All totally unprompted information given in answer to the question ""How are you enjoying the room?""

This puts me on edge because while I feel for the guy, my AirBNB is focused towards business professionals, not people trying to pick up the pieces of their life.

They report that he walks around the house in just his boxers and got into a heated debate with some door-to-door Jehovah's Witnesses about the existence of God. My neighbors across the street tell me that about an altercation they had with him which frightened their teenage daughter. Yep, this guy needs to go.

Several hours were spent today communicating back and forth with AirBNB, with the guest's sister who explained that the guest is a recovering alcoholic who likely has fallen off the wagon, with the guest's father who is apparently already en route from Pakistan to deal with his son's issues in person, and occasionally with the guest himself who was not at the house but called for brief, sporadic, and senseless conversations that gave further validity to his sister's falling-off-the-wagon theory. 

And the situation is not yet resolved, as he strung us along all day insisting that he was mere minutes away from the house to vacate the room yet never arrived.

I turned the camera to the wall, and messaged the host I choose option 2.   Host agreed to shorten the stay and I got refund of accommodation and service fees for unused night.  It was majorly inconvenient because I had to rush in the AM and pack, get to a meeting on time.    Since the host failed to acknowledge the camera should be in the listing and I checked again in the days ahead, I decided to contact support.

To my surprise 2 days later I'm told thanks for contacting trust and safety team, we've decided to issue a full refund and suspend the host's listing from being able to accept any more reservations pending the outcome of their investigation.  Wow!  I check their calendar and all days are unavailable, plus it gives me an error : you can't access this resource.

Oops!  Didn't expect that to happen.  No doubt the host will leave a retaliatory review.   I didn't mean for her account to get suspended, after all she was responsive.  

The host could've been honest in other ways too. She ""forgot"" to disclose that the space is shared by 10+ other people while she has just one listing (apparently there are several long term tenants).  Host doesn't live on site and has her son doing the communication with guests as a co host of sorts.  That wasn't disclosed either.  Whole time I was messaging the host thinking I was ""chatting"" with a woman, it was actually a man and I didn't know that until a long term tenant tipped me off.",0.78,24,1564116714.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/chyh54/wow_it_turns_out_they_take_trust_and_safety/,True,22

We had our bridal party get ready there before a wedding so we moved some living room furniture around to accommodate and didn’t put it back in the original positions because we couldn’t remember the layout. Everything else was clean and we followed all other rules. The AC was broken upon arrival and the house was 85 degrees the first night, maintenance fixed it in the morning of the second day. The listing showed four full bathrooms but there were only three, the showers did not drain well and there was only enough hot water for one shower and everybody else had to take cold ones. There was a hot tub but it was filthy and unusable. Unfortunately we did not document these while at the site (I included the fact that the ac was broken and the hot tub was dirty in the private review portion while reviewing our stay). Received a message from Airbnb that our host is requesting $250 for extra cleaning. I responded saying the ac was broken and the hot tub was filthy but other than that the place was left clean. Airbnb responded it was due to moved furniture and garbage left outside  (we left our gathered garbage bags outside near the receptacle because there were no extra bins). My husband is saying to refuse this extra charge because of the inconveniences we experienced at their rental but I think we are SOL because we did not complain sooner nor document properly (aside the AC and the lack of shower as the listing shows) or ask for refunds first.

adb20830-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Bad experience- looking for advice,"Hi all,

I’m staying at an Airbnb for 3 months during an internship. I have been here ~6 weeks already. I have been having two separate issues that have been impacting my stay. I’m looking for some advice on how to better the situation.

Just a little background for context; the host (owner of the property) does not live at the house. He rents out all of the rooms and has a previous guest, now co-host, stay at the house to take care of the guests. They are both in the Airbnb message thread for my stay.

Issue 1: Air Conditioning. It is very hot and humid where we are. The listing shows “air conditioning” under amenities. For the first week, everything was fine. However, after the first week the power breaker kept tripping, and I was asked to not use my AC window unit. The rest of the house is on the same central AC, but my room is not attached to that. Additionally, when I asked when it would be fixed his response was “we have no plans on upgrading our power”. I was given a 5 inch desk fan to cool my room, which is definitely not enough. Today, after leaving the fan on all day, it was 78 degrees  F and 70 percent humidity in my room.

Issue 2: Internet. They have WiFi listed as an amenity. I’m a pretty big gamer, and I’m a programmer as well. Having reliable internet is essential. I messaged the host BEFORE I booked asking if I could plug in my own router. Not only did he allow me to, but assured me that they have high speed Internet (150 Mbps download). I get to the place and their WiFi is terrible. For the first week while I wait for my router and PC to arrive from shipping, I can barely even browse the Internet. Having huge issues with even just Reddit or Facebook via WiFi. I get my router, and everything begins working fine. I do a Speedtest when no one is home: about 30 Mbps down. Whenever the co host or her cousin are home, they are streaming 4K videos on the tv and it slows the network down immensely. However, when my router is plugged in, it slows them down. A few weeks pass and the host asks that I unplug my router and use WiFi. Now, I would be okay with this, but now I’m working with 1 Mbps Down. I can barely do anything on the Internet, and now opt to do most of my browsing on my phone. Homework and work I have to do at Starbucks. Video games I have to drive a half hour to an Internet cafe.

I’ve voiced my concerns multiple times with the host, and he often ignores them. Sometimes the co-host will tell me that she will contact the host about it, but I never hear back. I’ve been taking screenshots of speed tests and pictures of a thermometer to document this. 

What can I do? I can’t find anywhere near close to me to move to in a reasonable price range. Do I just tough it out and submit a complaint to Airbnb? How likely will they refund at least part of my stay? How much can I expect them to refund if they do?",0.88,24,1562205120.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/c8wou3/bad_experience_looking_for_advice/,True,49

Just wanted to get some thoughts on this as I've wondered this for awhile. 

Anyone else stay at an AirBnb where the hosts were just too much? I've stayed at many AirBnBs, all relatively pleasant, but this last stay, a whole house in Long Beach, struck me as weird. The host was very specific with rules, when we could go into the backyard, how we were suppose to clean up, etc etc. There was a literal binder full of rules. The jist was to leave the house in the same state of cleanliness as when we came. She left me the review below:

""Michael and his group were quiet, clean, and respectful. We recommend them to other hosts. My only minor complaint was lack of communication — they didn’t let me know they were arriving three hours early, and didn’t respond to my request to let me know when they were leaving.”


In this review, the host basically said I wasn't good at communicating because I didnt tell her that I was showing up earlier than expected (yet 2 hours after check in time) and didnt tell her when I left (which was about an hour prior to check out time. I feel like a lot of hosts think we're their guests vice paying customers. For the rules, it felt like I was with my parents or something. For the cleanliness,  while not an outlandish request, if you're going to expect me to clean up crumbs and sweep up then don't charge a cleaning fee. People utilize Airbnb's to be away from home, some for work, some for vacation, I dont want to worry to have to clean their house too.

What to do?,"We recently booked a place in the mountains and when we showed up, we discovered the place was a completely different listing (30% cheaper, we were sure as we considered it earlier). We contacted the host and he showed apologetically saying the other place wasn't ready at all. He offered us free stays for our next trip. It was late and out of the way so we decided to stay first and discuss what to do as a group the morning after. We decided that we'll just get price difference back since it didn't make sense to make other plans at the last minute for a large group. We messaged the host the day after and he never responded on that message. As we departed from the property, he wrote back saying that he won't refund anything since the place we stayed was better. He jacked up the price on the listing we stayed at and said the price we saw earlier was not for the 'season'. 

&#x200B;

We then reached out to Airbnb's resolution center and they simply replied that their guest refund policy dedicates that the matter should be reported within 24 hrs of the initial stay. Nothing they could do as the money is already sent to the host.

After messaging a bit with the incoming guest on Friday, I set her up to self check in because her flight wasn't coming in until 11:00pm.  Since her reservation is for Feb 2-Feb 6, I assumed she meant 11:00pm SATURDAY.  

So at 12:33am, my phone rings and wakes me out of a dead sleep (this is the sleep of a high school science teacher on a Friday night/Saturday morning.  My week was loooong).

She starts to argue so I say, ""hold on,"" and get out of bed and go to the door.  After all, I have a guest who is presumably asleep in the casita and she and her friend are on the porch, talking on the phone.

By the time I get out there, she's apologizing profusely about the mix-up.  She was very nice, I was bleary and stupid from sleep and she says they'll find a place to go.  I apologize that I couldn't accommodate her right then because someone was asleep in the casita.  She asks if they can just drop their bags off, which I said was fine.  I'm not sure that was a good idea, if it opens me up to an accusation of something missing or not, but I definitely wasn't thinking straight and what's done is done.

AirBNB linked to their policy on [emergency or unavoidable circumstances](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1320/what-if-i-need-to-cancel-because-of-an-emergency-or-unavoidable-circumstance) \-- but in this policy it just shows Blizzards or severe winter storms as a ""valid"" cancellation reason.  Blizzards or severe winter storms are  National Weather Service classifications -- but neither of theses classifications were used for this storm.

Has this happened to others?  It doesn't work for us if - during  winter storm warnings - AirBnB allows the guest to cancel.   Hotels in Tahoe, like the Resort at Squaw Creek, do not allow weather cancellations. 

For a lot of guests, who like fresh powder to ski/board on, this would have been a perfect weekend to go up in ski.  

Have others had AirBNB approve cancellations against their cancellation policy during winter weather?  Maybe we should just allow VRBO reservations only in the winter?

I'm skipping the more common sense ones (follow house rules, etc) in favor of some that well-meaning guests are less likely to think of.  I'm sure other hosts can add to this list:

1.  Don't water plants unless I ask you to.  Overwatering plants can kill them, so unless you are on a long stay and I ask you to water them, please don't; I have a set watering schedule.

2.  When you check out, leave routine housekeeping chores, if you are not specifically asked to do them, for the host.  If you spill a drink on the floor, by all means clean it up, but don't take out the trash (unless it's smelling up the room), strip beds, or start the laundry.  I empty the wastebaskets last when I am doing a turnover, because I throw stuff away in them as I clean, so why do it twice and use extra bags?  I wash towels separately from sheets, and when I dust the light fixtures above the beds, I'd rather do it over dirty sheets that I'm about to wash anyway than over the mattress I'm about to put clean sheets on.  Bottom line is that anyone who hosts frequently is going to have a set routine for doing turnovers, and since you as a guest don't know what that is, doing stuff that seems helpful actually might be mildly annoying.  So save yourself the trouble! 

3.  Communicate!  If you can't find something that you think should be in the house, or you aren't sure how to work something, please don't worry about bothering me, just ask!  Hosts also appreciate knowing about anything that breaks or doesn't work, even if you don't consider it a big deal.  For example, recently a doorknob broke during a guest's stay; this isn't something I would ever charge for, because it was simply due to it being old.  However, I'd much rather find out about it when it happens, so I can buy a new one, than when I arrive to do the turnover and have three hours to get the place ready for the next person.  

All of these tips are minor things that guests may not think of, but that as a host I really appreciate.",0.93,25,1531163417.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8xf07x/nonobvious_advice_for_guests/,True,20

Playing phone tag with a guest who's in a mental hospital was getting frustrating, and her discharge was supposed to come on Monday, then it was Tuesday, then it was Tuesday or Wednesday.  I started coming around to the idea of [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/8q0wc9/update_to_how_bad_of_a_knock_is_it_to_get_rid_of/e0fqs6g/).

So I tried talking to the nurse at the hospital about dropping her stuff off and she forwarded me to the VM of a social worker, where I left a message.  I had her parents' number from my phone history (she called me from there once), so I tried calling her parents but no one answered.

While I was at the gym, her dad called me back and we decided he would come over that night and we would pack up her stuff. She was against the idea but she's in a mental hospital so the sane people made an executive decision.

Her dad, a super pleasant older guy (guest is in her 40s) came over and we very collaboratively packed up her stuff and put it in his car.

So thank goodness this saga is over.  I feel for her dad--what parent has a kid thinking that as she reaches middle age, she will lack the most basic skills of existing in society?  I did all I could to ease his burden and be helpful and cheerful.

I ended up turning down an additional guest because of this situation, so I updated Airbnb support and asked them to remove my negative mark for declining a reservation, given that I had to decline due to circumstances beyond my control.

I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by Airbnb's responsiveness.  It's been a while since I hung around on this subreddit and back then, we were all working under the assumption that Airbnb support was essentially nonexistent and we were on our own.

Now we all know support is not exactly in favor of the hosts, but they were at least available and polite.  So there's that.

Having said all this, I may be on the path towards no longer renting on Airbnb.  I haven't taken down my listing yet, but even if only 1/50 guests are like this, and I get a knock on my rating if I decline a guest with no reviews yet (I will no longer accept a guest with zero reviews), maybe the writing is on the wall.

Thanks for joining me on this sordid journey.",0.9,25,1528805579.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8qifry/final_update_on_my_crazy_literally_guest/,True,21
adb2289c-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Back to Back nightmare guest rant,"I have been a host for 4 year and am a proud super host. I have really enjoyed hosting and found that 98&#37; of the time everything goes great. There are however bad parts of hosting which in which we as hosts count on you, Airbnb, as the facilitators for support. After all we are able to set a security deposit and have a ""MILLION"" dollar guarantee right. Well not so fast. My last two guests have been total nightmares and I have found that you as a company do not have the hosts back. 

 I know what hosting entails and have grown some thick skin dealing with issues and have only turned to you for support as a last resort. My second last guest threw a rave at my house, complete with professional DJ equipment, strobe lights, full access to anyone who wants to come in. My neighbours and their young kids called the cops at 2 AM to shut things down. I have been in touch with your team and am grateful for their instruction on how to deal with this guest. I had asked them to leave and waited for an hour while they cleaned up and packed all their DJ gear. I called back and asked to have this goest removed from the system but low and behold he was still able to leave me a review. WHAT? This guest can continue to rent airbnb and rave away cmon!!

The next guests checked in the next day. Now, I had renovated the bathroom 6 months prior on account of the excessive wear and tear an airbnb has. But no problem its part of the territory.  These guests had completed damaged my newly renovated bathroom vanity by running excess water while the drawing was closed which flowed down to the cabinets below. I had enough and submitted a money request for damages to replace the bathroom vanity. I would do the labour myself so I only asked for the parts.  Along with that I submitted all the photos and documentation.  I heard nothing from AIRBNB for 4 days until I got an email saying the claim was denied. WHAT?!?!? I called up the 1\-800 number but only received sympathy and assurance that they would pass the info on to the security department. I reached out to AirBnb Help on twitter and I received reassurance that the claims department would reach out to me. 

Somehow the claim was reviewed and I received $1050 of the $1350 I requested. Now why the claims department approved only 78&#37; of the claim and not the full 100&#37; is beyond me but it’s  petty to withhold the rest. I tried calling again which resulted in sympathy from the agent on the phone but nothing more other than a promise to send the message to the appropriate department. I had asked to speak to them, or have them call me back 3 times now.  Withholding the $300 really seems like a power play on the part of the AirBnb. What if the damages where 13 thousand not 13 hundred?  I have guests who are supposed to check in tomorrow however I will not be giving them access to my property.  Since AirBnb broke their end of the deal I do not feel comfortable with the platform anymore.   I have 20\+  bookings over the summer ranging from hosting groomsmen before a wedding to 70th birthday parties. All of which will not be fulfilled over a petty $300 claim withhold made by an agent who won’t spend 5 minutes giving me a phone call which I have asked for at least 5 times. ",0.86,25,1527814565.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8nnqax/back_to_back_nightmare_guest_rant/,True,21
adb22a0e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Newly announced target of having to accept 88% of all reservation requests (Progress>Opportunities>Basic Requirements),"Hi all,

I am pretty annoyed at this new provision that was rolled out recently. I am considering writing a message to airbnb support. submitting it here first, any thoughts? See draft below, thanks in advance.

Hi there,

just a little feedback on your newly announced target of accepting at least 88% of all reservations:

I feel this is quite an oppressive move. The permanent nudging towards enabling the Instant Book feature already left a foul taste in my mouth. Airbnb keeps trying to squeeze the hosts performance into a mandatory model, instead of letting hosts decide with whom they feel comfortable sharing their home with. This is a VERY personal and VERY sensitive subject, and frankly, Airbnb is NOTHING without the hosts. So if I don't like the way a potential guest messages me, e.g. if they don't even bother addressing me by my name, then I reserve the right to not accept their reservation. This has nothing to do with discrimination, but rather with manners and common courtesy, or a lack thereof, the former of which I expect from anyone who I would consider renting my home to. I don't see anything wrong with that, and I don't see why I should be penalised for it. I know it is all about the bottom line and shareholder value in the end, and that the hosts are merely the cattle who are supposed to shut up and make profit for the company, but at some point this practice of conducting business with the people who are doing all the work without which the company couldn't exist is starting to become a bit too fascist in its approach to stomach. The threat of a hosts listing being subject to removal if they don't hit the newly imposed target doesn't help to alleviate this feeling, and I don't think it is a constructive way to communicate with superhosts, who are doing an excellent job according to your own metrics. My home is NOT a hotel, and it will NEVER be a hotel. So please don’t try to make me have to behave as if my home were a hotel. Pretty simple.
THAT is something YOU need to work on improving.

adb23206-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Am I being an asshole?,"My wife and I recently listed a private room on AirBnB. We live in an area with pretty much year round tourist traffic. Hiking/kayaking in the summer/spring/fall, skiing and such in the winter. 

The space is basically our entire second floor, a living room/office area and a bedroom with a private bath. We list it as a private room versus an apartment because it doesn't have a private entrance and you need to come through the house to get there. 

Because we didn't want kitchen drama we included a mini-fridge, a microwave, a coffee pot and some glasses, dishware and silverware up there. All neatly organized. All new (but cheap) stuff. We also provide tea bags and coffee at no extra charge. My listing specifically states that we don't let guests use our family fridge or appliances.

First few guests came in and said ""Wow, this is great! It's like a hotel in here!""

Things were looking up.

Lately, I'm getting inundated with requests for long term stays. Apparently, the local hospital hires a lot of out of town specialists (physicians, nurse anesthetists etc. Who knew?). So, despite my listing saying a four day max, I'm getting tons (like 5 unique requests per day) for long term rental of at least 5 days per week, every week, into the future.

I've even specified that we aren't interested in long term rentals in the listing. This is a part of my house that I regularly use. I'm totally down with making a few extra bucks by renting it out *periodically* but I'm not interested in losing half my house. It's a tight rental market around here. If I wanted that, frankly, I'd seek a tenant (with a lease) outside of AirBnB.

The first few accepted the news fairly well. Lately I'm getting people who are a bit more aggressive with my decline. They are telling me I'm a scammer, I'm an asshole, one claimed I'm a racist and just didn't want an Indian in my house (not true, my guests come from around the worlds *up to the maximum stay.*).

Is this normal? Am I somehow misleading these people despite my listing clearly stating that I don't want a long term rental? 

The latest message I received stated ""I don't want long term, I just need it for like six months."" Am I phrasing it improperly? To me, long term means we are working out monthly rates.

adb23382-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,What to Include in the Review for this Guest?,"We have just hosted a guest from hell and there were multiple issues with them. There are so many that I don't believe that it will be possible to include everything in a review. If it is it will certainly be too long. I am not sure what things I should leave out of the review.

The guest's trip was cut short due to their behaviour but, as both parties were happy with the trip being shortened, I am able to leave the guest a review.

I have already trimmed several issues which are trivial by comparison, but the worst issues are as follows:

1. Booked a private room thinking they had booked an entire home. Would not accept that both my listing and their itinerary said that it was a private room. They spent their entire first day arguing with me about it. Once they had realised their mistake, they tried looking for ways out of the booking without having to pay (we have a strict cancellation fee).

2. Complained that our listing said that we provided towels but hadn't provided them with any. Initially they told me that they didn't want them as they had their own towels.

3. Couldn't understand the concept of a towel rack and stored their towels crumpled up on the floor. Whenever I placed them back on the rack, they placed them back on the floor immediately (this definitely wasn't a case of them falling off of the rack as they placed their towels on the opposite side of the room).

4. Complained that their towels weren't clean enough after a few days and I hadn't provided them with new ones. What were they expecting given where they were storing their towels? They also hadn't bothered to ask for new towels before complaining.

4. Used one of the towels I provided them with to wash the bathroom floor instead of the mop, which is stored in the bathroom.

5. Complained about my toiletries being in the bathroom as they were offended by the sight of toiletries that did not belong to them.

6. Pretended that there was mold and a horrible smell in our apartment when neither are there.

7. As they couldn't get a refund if they cancelled, they decided to try and minimise my profit by leaving as many lights and electronics on at all times.

8. Decided that the sink was the best place to store our microwave once they were finished with it instead of putting it back where they got it from (fortunately they didn't place it in water).

9. I told them not to park in the building as the parking fee is $4 an hour and suggested that they park across the street for $3 for every 15 hours. They chose to park in our building for $4 an hour and have the bill sent to us.

10. Gave me a tirade of verbal abuse when I reminded them of the house rules for the umpteenth time.

11. Complained that we hadn't provided them with fresh bedding after a few days. They were told upon check-in to let me know when they needed fresh bedding and I would provide it for them. They couldn't be bothered to ask me for it though and expected me to automatically know that they wanted a fresh set.

12. Stained the mattress with coffee and an unidentified purple goopy substance. Given the sheer amount of the latter, I suspect that this was deliberately poured over the mattress in order to ruin it. They flipped the mattress to try and hide it, but I spotted it immediately as I always check the underside of the bed when a guest checks out.

13. Attempted to blackmail me into not leaving a review, telling me that they have experience with this, know exactly what they are doing and will see that I never host again if I say anything bad about them.",0.94,24,1515275712.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/7om9ls/what_to_include_in_the_review_for_this_guest/,True,25

adb23f9e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Pretty bad AirBnB experience. Only lasted an hour.,"(I'm linking to this reddit post in my review on airbnb because they don't allow many characters in their review.  I'm not sure if this is the right way to write about this, but it's the best I could think of.)

My stay with Arian was quite strange.  There were red flags consistently throughout the ~1.5 hours I stayed there, and I felt uncomfortable after just a few minutes with him.  This feeling increased and I felt unsafe by the time I left his house and went to find a hotel to sleep.  I don’t know what kind of recourse I can have to get my money back, but I mostly just don’t want anyone else to have to interact with him without know what they are getting into.

I arrived in Indy around 5pm on Friday, stopped to get some dinner and buy a few groceries (instant noodles, breakfast food etc).  I messaged (and texted) him that I was arriving soon and got to his place around 6/6:30 (flash floods happened right as I arrived, it was difficult to get anywhere).  When I got to his place, the first sign was that he didn’t have any lights on in his house, and it was quite dark.  There were 2 candles out to give a small amount of light but it was strange.  He shows me to my room, and I put my stuff down and ask if I can put some eggs in the fridge.  He shows me the kitchen and it’s pretty dirty, used pots and pans on the stove and in the sink, the entire thing needs a decent clean.  I put my stuff away.

The first thing he does say he has something cool to show me in the basement, and so he takes me downstairs (quite dusty, not a very clean environment) and shows me what used to be a microwave.  I can’t really tell what is going due to poor lighting, but I see exposed wires and he starts to tell me that he took apart this old microwave.  He then shows me a long bent metal pole and wire contraption and explains that this is the microwave component and he can shoot it at things.  He explains that he can set aluminum on fire, and its also a great weapon against people because they have no idea whats happening to them but they feel awful.  An additional bonus of this device is it has a long range.    So I’m disturbed at this point, but laugh nervously and we head upstairs.

I explained to him when I booked the room that I play magic (card game) and he was very excited about this, and he brought this up and showed me his decks.  I agreed to play a game with him (I could tell he wasn’t really malicious, he just wanted to impress me or be my friend, so I hadn’t decided to leave yet).  Some of the pieces we played with were not ‘legit’ and he had printed them off on paper.  Instead of soldiers/angel images they were images of nude/nearly nude anime girls.  Throughout the game he would refer to them as ‘his girls’ and point out girls he specifically liked a lot.  
At this point I’m sure I’m not staying here, so I finish playing and head to my room to grab my stuff. 

He follows me and continues to talk about his hobbies and explains how he is a ninja master and proceeds to show me how to ninja walk through his house.  He offers to teach me (but not the deadly moves, because I wasn’t ready for those yet) and I try to refuse but he continues to show me and explain the moves.  I wouldn’t of minded but he kept getting uncomfortably close to me, and I was already in my room and I didn’t have anywhere else to move to get more space.

I can tell at this point that he isn’t being malicious but rather he is trying to impress me.  I’m guessing he doesn’t interact with people often and doesn’t understand social cues or norms.  

He explains that the only AC unit in the house is in this bedroom and requests that I leave my door open so that the AC can flow throughout the evening.  I promptly get my stuff, forget about the few groceries I bought in the kitchen, and leave (leaving his key on his dresser).  

I didn’t know how to tell him that I didn’t feel safe here, so I told him I was going to get a coffee or something, and texted him later that night that I wasn’t going to be staying at his place.

Additional red flags:  
The level of dirtiness of the place was quite high.  Cobwebs in the front room, dirt, random food/raisins (god I hope those were raisins) on the ground (including in my room).  I tried to get a glass of water, and he recommended using the filtered water.  The filtered water had dirt/specs in it.  I look into the top of the filter and theres hair/dirt/grime in there.  The shower was quite gross looking, stained, grime, early on I just thought I wouldn’t shower the first morning.  The ‘dining room table’ needed to be cleaned badly, not sure why he used a table cloth when he never changed them. 

Final thoughts:
I don’t think he’s a bad person, he just is lacking interpersonal skills necessary to host people.
If I was a female I would have been extremely freaked out by this guy.

adb243f4-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Weird experience my 2nd time hosting (guest had a fake profile),"I started hosting in December and have now had 6 guests, all great. My 2nd guest had no Airbnb history, but I accepted the booking to generate reviews. She and her son were excellent guests (i.e. left the place spotless), so I gave her a 5-star guest rating.

When I see that she has reviewed me back, it is scathing, with negative comments about cleanliness (no other guest has had an issue) and very low star ratings (I have so few that I can tell by how it has impacted my totals). Including things such as low rating for Value, when my condo was listed at probably 30% of comparables since she was one of my first bookers. I was gutted, but left a response to the review as best I could and moved forward.

Today I'm searching around Airbnb to look at competitors, and I see that a person with the same profile photo is renting their own apartment a couple of blocks away. It is her, but with a different name - a google search with this new name confirms she's the same person I met at my apartment. She is a Superhost. In other words, she made a fake-named second profile, booked my apartment, and left terrible ratings.

I don't know her motivations, but obviously I am angry because I already felt that the review was below the belt, and now I feel that her actions were extremely dishonest. Does anyone have thoughts on this? Is it something Airbnb Trust and Safety should know about?

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the encouragement, I wasn't sure if I was on crazy pills or something. I will be in touch with Airbnb today and report back!",0.88,26,1421044559.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/2s53u5/weird_experience_my_2nd_time_hosting_guest_had_a/,True,21
adb245a2-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Three Star Review for not Having a Hot Tub + Other Guest Trying to Get a Full Refund Five Days Before Check-in,"Just venting more than anything.

A guest who stayed two weeks ago left a review that went live today. Everything she said was positive, apart from a couple of sentences in the middle of the review.

She basically complained that there wasn't a hot tub at my listing but then even said herself that, if I had one, my place would have been more expensive and she wouldn't have been able to afford to have booked my listing. There's then a little speech about how much things should cost, before she said that my place represented good value for money.

The review concludes by saying that there were no problems at all and everything about her stay was very good.

I contacted the guest afterwards asking why she left me a three star review if she didn't have any problems with her stay and had a good time. I asked if there were any other issues apart from the fact that I don't have a hot tub as I want to make sure that other guests don't encounter the same issues. I also briefly explained how Airbnb's rating system works.

She got back to me saying that she used to stay in expensive Airbnb's that offered services such as massages, personal chefs, free bottles of champagne on arrival, etc. She told me that she has fallen on hard times and can no longer afford such luxuries. As my listing didn't meet the same standards as the Airbnbs she used to book, she can't justify giving me the same star rating she gave those so I should be content with a three.

____________________

In another issue, I had a guest book my listing FIVE months ago. I sent her a message on the day she booked making sure she knew that she had booked a private room and not an entire home. She skipped over that message and asked some other questions at the time. I repeated it again after answering her questions. As she never replied and I had informed her twice, I assumed all was good.

Today, five days before she is due to check in, she told me that she has only just read the messages I sent her five months ago and is insisting that I cancel her booking for her so that she can get a full refund.

I have explained that I cannot cancel the booking for her and that, if she wants to cancel, she will have to do so. In response she told me that there is no mention of the fact that my listing is a private room in the house rules. Obviously that's because it isn't a rule, but it mentions this in the listing's title, the very first line of the listing and the description.

She stopped communicating with me and has had a friend of hers text me. This guy is adamant that I owe her a full refund because I HAVE to put it in the house rules otherwise I am running a scam and they will report me to Airbnb and the police. Airbnb have already been informed and the agent I spoke to laughed at the guest's idiocy.

The booking is still active, so I assume that I will receive a one star review in six days time. Something to look forward to...",0.97,24,1574617816.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/e11s81/three_star_review_for_not_having_a_hot_tub_other/,True,7

Long-time lurker. Obvious throwaway account. 

I host part-time, but I'm as busy as I want to be so I've never really paid much attention to the other listings in my area. 

After reading a bunch of posts, I was curious to see what the guest experience was like, so I started poking around other listings and almost immediately, I noticed a bunch of duplicate/fake listings, and what appears to be a fairly robust network of sock-puppet reviewers tied to them, similar to the article that's been going around. I reported the obvious stuff, but nothing has been taken down in nearly a week.

I don't want to post listings and user profiles here because if I'm wrong, I don't want to ruin someone's legitimate business, especially in my own backyard. I also don't want to come off like I'm trying to knock out the competition, far from it. I'm just concerned about some of the stuff I'm seeing, and what appears to be an utter lack of quality control:

-Obvious scam listings
-Hosts with multiple 3-star listings and terrifying reviews
-Corporate hosts with 30+ copy-pasted placeholder listings that basically say ""this is a placeholder""

If some of the more seasoned folks on here would like, I can PM links, but I'm not comfortable blasting that info in case some of these folks are legit and I'm reading too much into it. I'm just really disappointed at the experiences of all the folks in the reviews, and frustrated that Air doesn't seem at all concerned about getting these obvious bad actors off the platform. Is there a hotline or some sort of escalation team I can send this stuff to?
I don't have Twitter so that's out of the picture unfortunately.

Sorry for being negative. I do try to focus on the positive experiences which is 99% of them, and I think I'm really lucky in that regard. My guests have mostly been amazing people and I'm really thankful for that. Very few ruined towels, only the occasional broken glass. People don't seem to understand single-stream recycling, but then again, they're on vacation and don't want to spend their day cleaning and sorting through trash.

1) I went from a person with a lot of social anxiety to feeling comfortable around groups of strangers, because I was able to try out different ways of interacting with people in a low pressure environment.  It was also a relationship that I felt like I had control over, so it was easier for the initial interactions to occur.  Also, I was forced to make some sort of interaction, and constantly being pushed out of my comfort zone really helped me.

2) I went from living paycheck-to-paycheck spending most of my income on rent to a person who owns three properties in the span of 4 years

3) I have helped something like 20-30 homeless people off the street and into stable, independent housing.

4) I'm much better at remaining calm in stressful situations and have much better conflict management skills

5) I have met guests who turned into some of my closest friends

adb25d80-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Just had a positive experience that could have been bad - wanted to share,"We had a short turnaround and just before our last guest, my cleaner texted me saying that our 2nd bathroom shower curtain needed replacing.  I was busy so I turfed it to my husband who purchased a standard shower curtain and replaced it minutes before his arrival. I was already a little nervous about this one because he was minimal communication and only one (glowing) review and they were bringing dogs. He eased my mind when he texted his safe arrival (down low on the check in instructions so I knew he read the house rules). 

He checked out without incident and left me a review immediately. It took me a couple of days to get to the house to inspect but our cleaner assured me all was well upon his checkout so I left him a glowing review to find out he'd also left me a glowing review and in his PRIVATE feedback mentioned that the shower curtain didn't reach and he was sorry he left some soaking wet towels as a result. I had forgotten to remind my husband that that shower needs an XL curtain - D'OH, my bad - fixed it right away. 

That could have easily turned into A) worse case a complaint not brought to our attention and a negative review or B) a better outcome of a complaint brought to our attention that we could fix immediately. I would have prefered the latter but was VERY pleased that he did not ding us for it. I suspect he just didn't want the hassle of us entering the home during his stay. I thanked him for his feedback and offered him a discount on any future stays. 

I am so grateful that most of our guests have had good experiences and have been patient with us when there have been issues. We've had three bad guests out of over 40 and while neither were catastrophic, I'd like to avoid similar issues in the future. It's hard to generalize from small numbers but this subreddit helps us understand what works and what doesn't. While all three of our bad guests were local, we've had plenty of local guests that were great. Locals who need overflow space for visiting relatives who are coming for reunions, showers, weddings and holidays have been universally great. Business visitors tend to the be absolute best in terms of following rules (movie studio business excepted). 

For the curious the bad ones were 1. a college student who threw a house party and disturbed our neighbors - she was deceptive about her plans, not sure how to avoid 2. a group of long term guests who needed a place to stay due to their communal living space not being ready for move-in on time (they literally broke everything in the house and texted us with ""non-issues"" daily) - would probably not accept another long term group with such odd needs without a more specific set of rules and a cash deposit and 3. a young woman cancelled upon check-in Halloween night because she saw a few tiny sugar ants in the house - we live in the US south and so does she - occasional insects are part of life - our pest service had just come and no amount of convincing her would change her mind that this was catastrophic so I suspect there was another issue. Our insect guy came the next day and several other times and never found the ants but treated anyway, no one else has complained. She didn't leave a review but I did lose thousands of $ on her long-ish stay as no one rebooked. Again, not sure how to avoid in the future. I did warn her at the time of booking that our street was a popular Halloween destination.

Communication and patience are key. Be willing to decline guests you are not comfortable with for specific reasons and take chances sometimes when your concerns are non-specific.  I personally feel that if I can warmly greet people face to face and present a small gift (bottle of wine, some local beer, or something specific for their visit), they have a better understanding that this is someone's private home and treat it accordingly; while I can't always do that, I make the effort when I can.

I'm so grateful that Airbnb has allowed us to keep our beloved home during a time of temporary relocation (5 years). I love hearing everyone's good and bad experiences and lessons learned both from the guest and host perspective. I learn something every time and it helps me continue to improve. I hope these stories continue.

I had 2 guests stay this weekend and when I got the review they had left me 3/5 stars overall because the 'Address was not provided'. They obviously have never used Airbnb because the address is provided once you complete your booking.

I contacted customer support and asked them to remove the review because it's clearly inaccurate and hurts my early rating and they said that it is not against their policy so nothing will be done. I wasn't getting my hopes up because I've heard how difficult it is to get any review removed but I figured for a clear inaccuracy there would be an exception.

They literally said even if you go to an Airbnb, have an amazing time, but leave a 1 star review that says 'There was no bed' or something of the sort that the review would remain.

adb26640-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Guest cancelled over flies in the house, Airbnb strong arms me into full refund after addressing issue, other issues with guests arise","(TL;DR: Airbnb guest rents private room, doesn’t read listing or respond to Airbnb messages, finds my foster cat and security cameras prominently listed in listing, asks me to cancel over a few flies in the room. Nature also listed in listing.)

We rent out a room in our house in LA. Suffice it to say, there’s some nature that happens in Southern California that I didn’t really know about as an apartment dweller prior to moving to a normal house. Ants here are just impossible to kill, and other critters come inside sometimes. It’s totally fine, but definitely something I took note of to add to the listing (and to prevent people from storing food and trash in the room and thus attracting them.) I have the house cleaner in every two weeks and we are meticulous about keeping everything spotless. 

Last week, a few flies showed up in the garage and somehow around 15-20 were getting into the house for a couple of days in a row. I checked to see if we had anything to attract them - garbage, or god only knows what that could have found it’s way in from outside - nothing. They’ll just be gone soon.

A guest booked on Friday for a one night stay on Saturday, and I figured it would be fine as the unwanted houseguests had been diminishing in numbers over two days. I spent the usual two hours cleaning everything and prepping the room for their stay before going off for my scheduled errands. Some aforementioned flies were still partying so I vacuumed them up with the dust buster. 

I couldn’t get a hold of the guest for them to set up the smartlock as they would not respond to messages on the platform, so I sent them a regular text message. They finally responded and I was able to rest assured they would be able to get into the house while I was out. (First mistake.) 

They arrived several hours later than their arrival time, and sent me several messages complaining about flies and could I cancel for them. After completing my errands an hour after they checked in, I returned home to address the issue. I realized I had left the door to the room open (a bright west facing room, probably the warmest of the house in the afternoon, should have closed the door but didn’t want them wandering into our messy bedroom) and there were definitely more of my mysterious fly houseguests invading (15-20) and no Airbnb guests. (Flies perhaps lurking still from the fact that I vacuumed the stragglers already in the morning, attracted by the light and warmth of the afternoon sun. No big deal, Dustbuster will make haste of them.) I was a bit upset because during my return from my errands my Airbnb guests left the door unlocked, according to my smartlock, something which is repeated in many places throughout my listing - lock up. I arrived to an empty house and dispatched the flies with the Dustbuster and informed the guest the problem was totally under control. 

Perhaps I am not that sensitive - our house is kept so clean and I am acclimated to the fact that bugs come inside, but was surprised at their abrupt departure. They didn’t want to come back and demanded me to cancel for them. I called Airbnb to assist because I’m always trying to be a good host, but also communicate that I do not want to cancel, the guest does, I have taken care of the issue. But their responses were normal texts and not through the Airbnb platform. Airbnb asked me to refund entirely - I said no, please retain at least the cleaning fee, and please inform the guest there is no issue with the listing, they should come back because the issue has been addressed. (And remains addressed, flies are totally gone. A mystery.)

So of course they refund them entirely for night. And then tell me I need to refund a cleaning fee. To which I say no, I performed the work of prep, and they do not need to cancel, there are no flies, it is several hours later and nothing is out of the ordinary. And Airbnb put more pressure on, do a full refund.

I got a little pissed at Airbnb and decided to review my Nest cam footage of their arrival. I have my two security cameras listed in the listing (again, multiple places! Also saying please let me know if you want them offline, I try to turn them off manually when you enter and are at home, etc., they’re there for security, they default to on when my husband and I are not home, we don’t really want to watch you we want to watch our pet and the security of the house. And definitely not in any bedrooms, in a hallway pointed at a side door to the outside and in living room at front door.) I was busy when they arrived since it was later than they said by two and a half hours and didn’t shut them off as I was busy with other things. When they came in, it was really clear that they didn’t read the listing at all because they saw my foster cat laying of the rug in front of the guest room and were yelling at her and poking her. (Kitty is also in the listing, in multiple places! I also always send a welcome message mentioning her, and have you read the listing? Do you know we have a cat?) It was upsetting because she was just doing her normal thing, laying around basking in the sunlight. They also waved strangely at the camera.

I have a feeling from reviewing the footage and their upset reaction to my foster kitty and waving at the camera that they had booked on impulse and did not at all read the listing, and were not happy to find a cat in the house just being a normal cat sleeping in sun spots. Or just how to interact with a cat. I prepped and did all the work and spent time corresponding with Airbnb that I did everything right in taking care of their complaint about flies  and I get nothing out of it. And they were abusive to my cat and left my house unlocked and vulnerable. We go about our life with a pet and concerns for security and disclose them openly to our guests in our listing, so they are okay with our lifestyle. They were not great guests, I got no money out of the stay, and I can’t even leave a review stating that they did not follow the house rules - leaving the door unlocked, clearly not reading the listing, harassing the poor kitty. 

Sorry to vent - any other hosts feel like Airbnb does not want to support the efforts of hosts? I really try my best to offer a very nice room in a nice place at an affordable price, but definitely feeling gypped by Airbnb for their support of a guest who clearly did not read anything as to what to expect for a private room in someone’s home. Do I have to just suck it up and accept no one will read even when I ask them to? Or is this just the expectation that everyone has, that even an affordable listing in a private home will have no pets, never any bugs, and no concerns for security. I care about their privacy and experience but also this is my home, and I have certain expectations of them as well - why don’t guests understand that when they book an Airbnb?

About a week ago, an older man named Pierre, booked my room stating that him and his wife would be arriving. We had been in communication throughout and he never stated that anything otherwise would occur.

The day of his arrival comes and instead of the couple I was expecting, a young woman and a teenage boy arrive at my door. Nobody that resembled the profile was with them. I was very surprised and told them that the room was only booked for two people. I thought that perhaps Pierre was late, or joining later. There was some conflict as the young woman and son did not speak much english. The young lady then stepped away and called ""Pierre"" and then handed me the phone. ""Pierre"" then told me that he had some issues and is not joining the trip and that instead he had sent his wife and son. Now in moments of sudden confusion, language barrier and still trying to piece things together, I'm not completely sending off welcoming vibes to my ""guests"" and I'm sure vice versa.

I don't know how to say this without sounding totally judgemental but the person who booked my room was an older white man retiree from Canada (appeared to be in late 50s-60s) who said he was here as a tourist. The mother who appeared is a very young african woman (mid-20s with a young son (who is not mix-race) who barely speak any english. I can't help but feel suspicious that something very fishy is going on but now I don't know what to do. I have contacted airbnb but what do I do next?

TLDR: I feel extremely uncomfortable having unstated guests in my house, yet I'm worried to have my first review being completely trashed. What do I do next?

**3rd Update:** The Western Union payment actually arrived and a new set of guests have booked for two of the three cancelled nights. What a bizarre experience. I'm not sure if I have the stomach for Airbnb but I'll try again.

**2nd Update:** Ok this story keeps getting weirder and weirder!

This morning I knocked loudly on the guests door until they woke up and opened the door. I asked them when they would be leaving and the lady told me she has called an uber and will be leaving in one hour. Soon after I get a call from Pierre who is now furious at me for waking them up(!!). He said that I had agreed to let them spend the night (which I did) and he didn't know why I was waking them up so early (it was around 7:30AM). He then said that he is just wants this issue to be over and that he is going to pay me for the night. At this point, I don't even care if I get paid for the one night, I just want the unregistered guests out. He asks me how I want to get paid since the reservation is cancelled. I tell him if he wants to he can just venmo or paypal me the money. He isn't familiar with either of those. He offers to send the money via Western Union (I know, this is getting ridiculous). I said fine and he says he then tells me the WU tracking number over the phone.

Then at 9AM, I hear the guests leaving the room. I go down and I see them leaving the front door and the same ""uber"" driver is with them from last night.

Now, this is the best part - the uber driver asks if he can talk to me. I said OK, so he tells me that what I did was very wrong. That when the mother and son arrived last night, I reacted the way I did because I was ""hoping to see a white man and instead I got a black woman and her black son."" I explained to him that I was not ""hoping"" to see anyone, but yes, I was ""expecting"" to see a white man and his wife (of any physical appearance, since she is not in the airbnb profile). He then tells me that her name is on the airbnb booking invoice next to Pierre's which he did in fact show me. (It was in french but both named were indeed there). I told him that I don't have a copy of the invoice, this is the first time I am seeing her name on anything related to the booking and all I see on Airbnb is that a old white guy named Pierre booked my room and that is who I was expecting.

Then they say that I should have had the ""decency"" to ask the wife to show me the invoice and her ID. I told them that she should have offered to show me once she detected that there was an issue! We went back and forth with both the uber driver and the wife saying that we are racist. (Actually the craziest part was the wife told me that I was ""cool"" but that my girlfriend is the racist bitch and treated her poorly).  I am trying to defend us as I live in a 90% black neighborhood and in fact my next airbnb booking is a black couple. I'm not even white! I'm an indian guy! The uber driver even told me that last night when we were having the conflict when he walked away that one of my neighbors on the street apparently overheard the whole thing and told him that ""They aren't going to let black people in their home"" (!!!).

In the end I just let them leave. The room looks fine in fact clean. It was a very, very odd experience for sure. It seems that maybe it was a misunderstanding. If I would have known the wifes name was on the booking I would have reacted differently.

**Update:** I know you guys were waiting for an update so here it is. I was exhausted last night and they are still here. I screwed this up majorly.

After posting, I called Airbnb who then called the registered guest, Pierre. The representative told me that she was having a very difficult time explaining to Pierre why he can't book a third-party and that she can cancel the reservation and then I can then take any means necessary to remove the woman and child from my home. I told her to cancel the reservation.

Then I went to the room and the woman and the boy wouldn't open the door for the longest time and then finally opened it and handed me their phone and Pierre was on the line. I couldn't even communicate with the woman and child as they don't speak english even though I know they know what is happening. I had this long back and forth with Pierre, with him telling me that it was his wife (he told the AirbNb representative that she was his girlfriend) and she was part of the original reservation so the only unlisted guest was the boy.  He pleaded for me to let them stay since it was now late in NYC.

Honestly, I didn't have the energy to argue. I had a very traumatic personal even earlier in the day and just wanted the day to end and I couldn't deal with any more confrontation. Also since there was a young child involved I felt bad just throwing their stuff out on the street. This would have been a physical confrontation as they were not moving. So now it's 7:00am and they are still here. AirBnB has cancelled the reservation and not only do I have complete strangers in my house but I'm not getting a penny for them. I know this sub isn't known for compassion and I'm sure many will say I am stupid for letting this happen. But my illegal guests caught my on a day where I just didn't have the physical or emotional energy to drag a screaming woman and child from a bed. They were not going to negotiate. I would be physically grabbing a woman and child down the stairs late at night.

I could call the police but I am in the outskirts of Brooklyn, NY and the last thing I need is the police taking a hour plus to get here, victim blaming me and then potentially getting involved with my Airbnb (which is totally legal by the way.). And then risking my standing with Airbnb - I really need the money right now.

I called Airbnb to ask if they could reverse the cancellation and charge the guest at least for one night but when I asked for the person who handled my case to call me back she never did.

So that's where I'm at. Great first time experience.",0.88,24,1534381583.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/97nv3w/first_time_hosting_unlisted_guests_have_arrived/,True,53
adb26da2-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"Someone has my keys, and maybe it's not my last guest","Trying to stay away from social media for a while, but I wanted to throw this one weird case up to the sub and see if anyone here has relevant experience. tl;dr relatively new AirBnB user cancelled his stay for dodgy reasons, asked for a refund (maybe in exchange for not leaving a bad review), and has not returned the keys two days after his stay.

I had a guest on Friday who cancelled after check-in, but before staying the night. He had checked in at 2 pm and immediately went into the bathroom to shower, and at 7:30 pm he called me from somewhere (not in my building) and told me he'd found the bathroom so dirty that he was not comfortable staying over. He asked for a refund. He also said he preferred to settle this between the two of us, without involving AirBnB support, because I have high ratings as a host and he didn't want to mess that up. (That sounds a little like extortion, but I chalked it up to his inexperience, rather than malice. His account was pretty new and had only one review, a brief but positive one.) I told him I didn't see any justification for providing a refund, as I'd cleaned the bathroom before his arrival to my usual Superhost standards. I encouraged him to contact AirBnB, provide photographic evidence of the bathroom being dirty, and argue his case for a refund. I checked the guest room at that time and noticed his bags were already gone. He never returned, and he cancelled his reservation shortly before midnight.

This guest was supposed to check out Saturday morning. Around 6:45 pm on Saturday he called me and asked if I could meet him that evening to hand off the keys halfway between my building and the spot where he was at that time, 7 miles away. At dinnertime on a Saturday, that was just not going to happen. I told him I needed the keys by 8 pm and asked him to drop them in my mailbox. I came back to my building around 12:30 am and found an empty mailbox. I messaged the guest to tell him as such. He quickly responded, saying he had ""made arrangements to have the keys dropped off"" by Monday at the latest.

So, a lot of things going on here that are pretty uncool (at this point, I really wish he'd messaged me to ask for a refund, instead of phoning me! I'd love to have a record of that exchange), but the one that concerns me immediately is that someone who's not the guest and not the postal service has a copy of my house keys right now. Have you had a guest walk with your keys? Have you had a guest tell you they gave your keys to a third party? What did you do? 

EDIT: The guest's friend mistakenly dropped the keys in my neighbor's mailbox. Also, the guest is now calling the circumstances around their cancellation ""a misunderstanding."" The responses here have been largely great. It's interesting to see how many courses of action there could be for resolving what appears on the surface to be a really simple issue.",0.92,22,1533575963.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/95373r/someone_has_my_keys_and_maybe_its_not_my_last/,True,24
adb26f14-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Open homes program needs a tweak ASAP,"I’m a host in California. Signed up last year during a small wild fire. Last week, a new batch of fires forced evacuations of several nearby towns. I was inundated with requests, and have welcomed two fleeing families onto my property. I wasn’t able to accommodate two other requests (the dates were different so they didn’t auto block out.) Concerned, I checked with Airbnb to see if declining them would affect my approval percentage. Yup, it does. 

Airbnb needs to fix this immediately. Great program, but Airbnb’s strict super host policies make this a risky proposition. Their solution when I reached out to support was for me to ask the guest to cancel the request. Are you kidding me? They are running from their homes. That is the last thing on their minds. Do I have to block out the next two months now so that Airbnb can get it’s PR bump?

It’s a small oversight in an otherwise fine program, but it needs to be addressed. Just wanted to let you other hosts know. 

Update #1: To clarify, hosts make no money through open homes. It a voluntary program and it costs the guests nothing. 

Update #2: We've turned off the open house program for our listing. Part is my fault, part is the chaotic nature of these evacuations and part is on Airbnb for flaws. Here are my major issues:

A. When a request comes in, it blocks out all other inquiries and makes the dates unavailable, even if pending. I learned this because one of the families we took in messaged us for a single day booking right after they were evacuated. I told them to just come and we'd work out the details after they get settled. The next day we tried to have them book through the program for the remainder of the week, but as soon as I opened the dates I was flooded with inquiries making it impossible for them to book. I couldn't send a special offer for $1 either, because the days under inquiry are unavailable. After trying to fix it twice with Airbnb, I just ate the declines, blocked off the dates and told them to stay as long as they needed.

B. There seems to be no limit to how far out people can request. One group requested weekend dates in three weeks. Assuming all goes well, these evacuations have lasted a week or two at the most. If for some reason conditions don't get better, I'd likely keep the families I'm already hosting. I don't fault the family for asking, but I have no control aside from blocking out all dates or eating rejections during hopefully profitable future weekends.

I called Airbnb CS team twice. They were helpful, but could only offer half measures. To those saying I should take it to Twitter, I'm not angry, just a little frustrated with the technical difficulties. I encourage everyone to explore this program if your area is hit by a disaster, but do so in a controlled fashion. 

What I would have done and will do for future disasters:
1. Keep Open Homes off initially. 
2. Blocked off all open dates for the following month before turning on the program.
3. Only open one or two immediate days. People rushing out of an area may only need shelter for a short period while they make more permanent plans.
4. If the group needs to stay longer, try to extend on the platform as needed but remember, Airbnb protections are nice but at the end of the day it's about helping. If they can leave and you're able to welcome another family, open up the next day.

I hope this is a somewhat helpful.

Next you bring extra people to the house without letting me know even though the rules states: additional people after 2 $15.00

I told her this through the app and she said I did not see that rule..

This host was a superhost, and while i understood i was only renting a single room, me and my SO had a very terrible experience actually staying there, mostly due to the other guests:

* Other guests constantly smoked weed inside the unit
* Other guests were constantly loud and noisy. Being woken up at 3 am with other guests screaming at the top of her lungs drunk was not fun.
* Guest threw up all over their bathroom, then were pounding on our door at 3 am saying they need to use our bathroom.
* Guest projectile vomited all over the the hallway 
* Other guests ate our food / drank our alcohol.

We sent a bunch of messages to the host complaining about these issues, but he was really quite slow at resolving some of them (like the vomit). He said he would talk to the other guests, ether he didn't or they didn't care. We ended up leaving a day early, simply because the other guests were being a huge pain in the ass, and we were exhausted from being woken up.

In the end i gave the host a 2/5, because frankly i had a shit time there. While it isn't really his fault, it was a terrible experience. Since posting that review the host has constantly been messaging me, demanding me to change my review since it isn't his fault, as he has no control over the other guests, and isn't objective. 

If it weren't for the other guests i would have had a great time. Does this seem reasonable to give a bad review like that?

adb2778e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,"How do you handle sick guests? (Directed towards hosts who live with their guests, not whole-unit listings)","And to be clear, I mean flu/bad cold, not cancer/chronic severe sickness.

We keep our medicine cabinet stocked for ourselves (obviously) but also share out all over-the-counter medicines with our sick guests. If someone seems really knocked out, I will make them tea (if I'm at home), and/or broth (my powdered bone broth) if they want. I'll also show them where the thermometer is, if they want to use it, and the heating pads/ice packs/etc. I'll also make sure they're aware of where the local urgent care is, and if I've barely seen someone for a whole day, I will knock on their door eventually and check and make sure they're not literally dying in the bedroom.
 
I did have one youngish guest years ago who I ended up taking to urgent care because she got a *killer* flu and I was really concerned for her. She was fine, but it took over a week for her to actually get better, and I willingly did a fair bit of nurse-maiding for her, because she was new to my city (just moved for a job) and was sick as hell and I just felt terrible for her. She (without asking) went grocery shopping for me and basically ""paid back"" all the soups and broths and bread/crackers I bought for her while she was down and out. But that was a pretty extreme example and it's only happened once in 10+ years that I've been doing AirBnB/renting out a room. 

Normally, the way I handle sick guests works great. But I recently had a guest that seemed to have the idea that I would be...*really* caring for them. Like on-call. And this was not a killer flu - in fact, I suspect it may have been more of a hangover than a flu. I cheerful disabused that notion immediately (""I'm so sorry you feel badly! Here is a cup of tea, and I've left several teas on the counter and the hot water heater filled if you need more. I'll see you later. Please feel free to use whatever you need in the medicine cabinet and I'll see you tonight.""), and then went about my day.

What about the rest of you hosts? Do you provide medications and such? Make tea? Or just politely sympathize and otherwise get on with your day? ",0.88,23,1526153553.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/8iych3/how_do_you_handle_sick_guests_directed_towards/,True,12

I have a nice place, 725 sqft, setup as a 1/1 apartment downtown.   I seem to be a magnet on this, as I have a higher rate and long (7 night) minimum stay.

When I get an inquiry I find 1/3 are unable to ever complete the transaction via airbnb (not my issue, but it does block it off for 24 hours), and another 1/3 are booking for someone else.  I've always checked ID and let people know they will not be checking in unless they have an ID with the same information on it.  

The most recent issue was someone booked for ""work"" and an under 21 yr old kid showed up to check in (license was vertical), and was not the person who booked it.  I let them know to come back with the person who booked it and I'll get them in (it was booked for 2).  Well there were 3 other college kids waiting across the street in the car.  When the kid who showed up went back to his car to ""straighten this out"", one of the other girls came back to the apartment and started pounding on the door (I was inside the unit still, didn't notice the car kids till after this).  She demanded to be let in and was screaming at the top of her lungs at me after I opened the door. 

I told her to calm down and explain what was going on, and she called me all manner of names.  This was disturbing my other tenants (I own the building), and I told her to leave and not come back and shut the door.  She was now banging on the door again, so loud it was reverberating throughout the building.  I'd had enough and opened up the door telling her I'm calling the police if she doesn't leave immediately, and she assaulted me at this point by spitting on me.  

I went out the back exit and this is when I saw the kids in the car across the street.  They came over and started to assume a semi-circle around me and the one who spit on me ran over.  About the time the police showed up, and got them calmed down, and handcuffed the girl.  I explained what happened and they let the 3 of them go, and arrested the one who spit on me. 

I contacted airbnb and explained it via email, airbnb _refunded_ the guests! 

Is it just me or is the quality of airbnb people going way down?

However, now I'm told that no matter the situation a person can leave you a bad review and regardless of the circumstances AIRBNB will not remove it.  This is the question I posed the manager verbatim.  "" A guest arrives, takes me hostage, shoots me, and is carried out by police.  Then he manages to get internet access and decides to log in and say he didn't like the way my house smelled and gives me one star.  You're telling me AIRBNB refuses to remove any/all reviews from people like that regardless of the situation?"". The answer I got was yes they won't remove the review.

I'm now scared to confront a guest, regardless of how ludicrous, because I have to be fearful of a 1 star review.  Thoughts?

**EDIT/UPDATE - I had an issue with a broken planter box so I had to speak with customer service today.  This time I happened to talk to a senior case manager completely randomly.  We actually had a really good conversation and he admitted that he hated how the policy is outlined and told me that case managers can pre emptively block a person from reviewing if a case is opened before the next guest checks in, it's just not a hard rule.

I told them that this would cost $4 per hour, so they would be better off parking in a car park that's less than a minute's walk away for $3 for every 15 hours.

The guest ignored my advice and has parked within the complex. According to him, they have allowed him to park here for free. But I know that there is no way that they will have allowed that and that the rate is $4 per hour.

When we had family park here in the past for two hours, we were sent a bill after they had left for $8. I suspect that our current guest has provided the staff with my name and our unit number and they have allowed him to park at our expense. As he is a registered guest, they will have allowed him to do this.

As he will be parking for 11 days, this could come to around $1000 in total depending on how often he is parked here.

adb2863e-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Advice needed- Stuck in an Airbnb with a screaming baby,"This is my first time using Airbnb. I’m currently staying on the east coast for my internship and I’ll be here for about 3 weeks. The room I have is not what I expected at all. There’s no comforter on the bed—in New England in winter—just a sheet and a light blanket. Luckily, I had the foresight to bring an extra. The mattress feels like a box spring. There’s also no dresser, just a clothes rack with 5 hangers, which is not nearly enough for the amount of clothing I have for a 3 week stay. 

The description said there’d be a doorman, which that, coupled with the fact that he’s renting other rooms in his house, made me thing this was an investment type property, not something with a full family living here. 

I could deal with those things but there’s also a screaming baby here. I don’t mind children, but I do mind being woken up by a crying infant who keeps crying throughout the day. Seriously, she’s been crying basically nonstop for the past 4 hours. I get that it’s not their fault, but I would have liked to know ahead of time that I’d be sharing a space with an infant. I have a high stress, high pressure internship with long hours and I’d like to be able to relax when I come home. 

Do I have any recourse here? The cancellation policy is 50% back, which as a broke college student on the expensive east coast, is not enough for me to get a new place. I’ve been here for one night and I don’t know if I can take 3 weeks of this. 

TLDR; I’m at an Airbnb for 3 weeks with no comforter, nowhere to put my clothing and a screaming baby. Is there any way I can get my money back?

Update: I called Airbnb and they were super understanding. They gave me a rebooking coupon worth what I paid for the room plus 10%. I’ll be in a new place by tomorrow!

adb287a6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Guest: Someone tried to get into our Airbnb while we were inside...advice?,"My husband and I use Airbnb frequently for work and personal travel. We’re currently staying in Rome on night 5 of a seven night reservation. Something sketch happened, I’d like the perspective of hosts or guests who have any insight. 

While we were inside, someone rang the doorbell. We don’t have a peephole. We did not answer since we weren’t expecting anyone. About two minutes after this, we heard a key in the door. My husband went to the door as it opened and there was a man with an empty ikea bag, he was slightly disheveled. Husband immediately shut the door. We then heard the keys in the doors of the apartments on either side of ours. About 3-4 minutes later an alarm went off on our floor in another apartment.

We messaged the host and messaged Airbnb right away.

The host was basically like “I’ve never heard of this happening, I didn’t send anyone” and that she and the guy who let us in are the only ones with keys. Couldn’t a guest make a copy of the keys? She then had another guy (someone who works at a restaurant downstairs) come check on the situation. He was nice and said he hadn’t seen anything nefarious and that we can ask him for help if we need it. This was fine but doesn’t explain what happened. 

The rental is in an apartment building, 3 floors with like 3 or 4 apartments on each floor. You need a key to get in the building and a different one for the apartment. It also seems like there might be multiple Airbnb’s in the building and the owner isn’t onsite. 

Airbnb said the host won’t do a refund but they would try to work something out. 

Am I being overly paranoid? Do you think we can count on a refund?I’m sketched out but don’t want to be put out for two nights of lodging. Honestly even if they don’t refund us I think we would leave just because we’re now nervous to leave our stuff in an apartment that was probably being cased and also nervous to sleep there when we can’t lock the door from the inside.

adb28bde-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Security Deposits and why you need one.,"Hey guys, I see a lot of people asking about security deposits, what's the point if there's a host guarantee, should I have one, and etc.

Well, I'm here to let you know that yes, you should have one, and why.

First of all, a security deposit is a lot easier to claim from in the event of damage, extra cleaning, and etc. Once you add in the host guarantee, your claim immediately adds months to it's life as that is like an insurance claim.

Now, I'll tell you a little known secret relating to your security deposit.

You know all of those extra fees you can put on your listing, such as checking out late, extra cleaning over your cleaning fee, etc? If you have a security deposit, your guest is agreeing to pay those charges from the security deposit. It's their pre-approval. If you do NOT have a security deposit, the guest is agreeing to those rules, but not to being charged, so it would not be legal for Airbnb to charge them any extra fees without their permission. Just make sure you put the exact amount of the charge in your description (a lot of people miss this).

Now all of this being said, it is important to remember that in order to charge a guest, you need proof. If they checked out late, take a picture with a time stamp of them or their things in your listing. If they left a mess, provide both your cleaning receipt from when they checked in and the receipt from the extra cleaning. If they smoked, provide a cleaning receipt that shows a smoking clean or evidence they smoked inside such as ashes on the table. Note: cigarettes in a trash can aren't necessarily proof. You do need to have irrefutable proof if you want to charge the security deposit without your guests approval.

And lastly, if you're worried about a guest not booking because of your security deposit.... don't be! Security Deposits are ONLY charged if you make a claim, so guests don't even see the deposit on their price breakdown. Many times when I handle these types of cases, the guests have no idea they agreed to a deposit at all.

I tell each guest that we are family friendly and that it is not uncommon for there to be children on the grounds at any given time (I own several cabins near a pond, so if any of my close friends and their families want to take a vacation, I allow them to stay there rent free and without any formal reservation.)

A few hours later I got the SAME auto generated email about ""your account has been deleted and we don't have to tell you why"" with nothing about the fact that strangers are planning to show up to my house.

I call their emergency phone number again and had to explain the entire situation again and beg for them to not hang up on me or ""put in another ticket"" and they reluctantly told me their only advice was to contact the guest and let them know their reservation is cancelled and give them Airbnb's emergency phone number. Which I did, and now i'm crossing my fingers these guests get the email and don't show up to my house since they already have my address and all contact info.

This is the most infuriating situation i've ever been through with any company of any kind. The lack of customer support, not just for me, but for guests that have already paid and are traveling across the world is utterly INSANE and dangerous! I feel very bad for this couple that had planned to stay with me, and I hope Airbnb does not completely screw them over too.

Feel ripped off & duped by a few issues with a booking. I'll try to list them.

1). Booked an ""entire place"" apartment, under the impression that, as Airbnb describes on their website, I was getting:
""Entire place: Guests have the whole place to themselves. This usually includes a bedroom, a bathroom, and a kitchen.""
Below the ""Entire apartment"", it says; ""Studio, 1 Bed, 1 Bath."" 

However, upon checking in & arriving, turns out the host & partner are living on site. They have changed the description weeks after booking & payment, to now say;

""My apartment is two studio apartments I take one side but I am away most of the time you will take the other side.
A kitchen and bathroom divide the studio into two.
You have a lovely space to yourself down the stairs.""

At the time of booking & payment, this information was not on the listing, and has since been updated. I understand that a Studio is self explanatory, and most of the facilities should be all in one room, but again, this information was not on the listing until obviously very recently. The owner is not ""away most of the time"", they have been here every day, and will continue to be. Photos of the listing have changed, a beautiful balcony (part of the reasons for booking the apartment), is on what I now know as the owners ""side"" of the listing. There is no private entrance, I am sharing a bathroom & kitchen with the owners, and have been left to a tiny little room.

2). Not only that, the room is not ready. This sneakily wasn't put on the photos due to crafty photography; the door has no handle, sections of the walls are still just gyprock sheet with studs & holes in them, and a fireplace that was supposed to be in my room, is now on the other side of a recently put in wall. This then leads on to the third issue:

3). The owners have scheduled labourers/workers to come in, and finish works on the space, while I am in the Airbnb. For the last 2, and the next 3 days, workers are coming in to finish off the plastering, cornicing and filling of gaps in my room, while I am supposed to be staying here. This is a pain in the arse, as each day at 8am, I've basically been forced out of the room/apartment that I've paid for, so that they can finish the room. 

In terms of resolving these issues, I understand that Airbnb wants guests to contact the owners, or message them via the Airbnb channels, but I have to live with these people, which makes it all a bit tricky. Don't want to start a huge argument that makes the entire stay horrible, but don't want to be completely fucked over.

This is my third airbnb experience so far. I’m looking for some insight from hosts as this seems a little strange to me and has proved to be a little irksome. I’m staying with a friend in a very small room with two twin beds in a two bedroom, one bathroom apartment. Our hosts live here and will be here for the duration of the visit (obviously normal). The hosts have racked up laminated “house rules” all over the apartment, and one of the “bathroom rules” is that we aren’t allowed to leave any of our belongings in it. So, we have to carry our toiletry bags two and from our room whenever we need to use the (shared) bathroom. I accidentally left my face wash on the sink, and the hand towel they left hanging on the rack,  and when I returned to the bathroom they had set both off to the side. I know it doesn’t sound like a huge deal, but it feels like we have to tiptoe around them and try to make ourselves as scarce as possible - especially given their preference for quietness at all times. It just seems unnecessary to have to take my shampoo out of the shower every time I use it, when it hardly seems in the way in the corner of their large walk in shower.

How am I supposed to have photos of non-existent parking? Or of someone using our ""private"" bathroom? (short of busting down the door and taking photos of someone using the toilet).

I'm baffled.

&#x200B;

The long story:

I booked a private floor with 2 bedrooms and a private bathroom in a bed-and-breakfast. The listing also said there was off-street parking (a major deciding factor since we had a rental car). 

A few days before check-in I messaged the host and she tells me to park in the street. Upon arrival we found it's a super-busy neighborhood with almost no street parking. We had to circle for 30 mins and park several blocks away. When I complained to the host she responded that everyone parks in the street and no one else ever had problems with it. 

A few hours before check-in the host messages us that she messed up the reservation, but had rooms for us. We weren't concerned since the listing said she may change around specific bedrooms. But when we actually go to check-in she tells us instead of a private floor with a private bathroom we're going to be on different floors sharing bathrooms with all the other BnB guests. We discussed it with the host and made it clear we would cancel without at least the private bathroom (we were within our AirBnb rights to cancel and get a full refund). She assures us she'll make sure we get a private bathroom, that she'll just have the guests on one floor use the bathroom on a different floor. With this agreement we checked in. 

Either she lied and didn't tell the other guests or they just ignored her. Regardless when we messaged her that night that people were using our ""private"" bathroom she immediately responded and said they weren't (she didn't even come up the stairs to check). The next morning when I told her that I literally was standing outside the bathroom while someone showered she responded it wasn't her fault that the other guests didn't listen to her.

I'm usually an understanding person (hey, we all make mistakes) and I've never filed an AirBnb complaint, but between the false listing claims of off-street parking, the last minute reservation changes, the unfulfilled promise of the private bathroom, then the blaming of other guests it ended up feeling like I was being purposefully snowed. 

I opened a AirBnb support case to complain about paying for a private bathroom with off-street parking and not getting either. I sent screen shots of the original listing and all the messages between the host and me clearly showing her telling me to park on the street and that she agreed to make sure we had a private bathroom, then didn't. 

After the initial, ""we're investigating"" response I don't hear anything for over a week and reach out for an update. On Saturday AirBnb Support responds and says that because I don't have photos of they're closing my request, which they proceeded to do. I can't even reply to the case.   


I called AirBnb customer service and the rep said she'd forward my concern to the support case owner.

adb2bfd2-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,What to write in the review for a bad guest,"Hi all, just had my first bad guest and I'm hesitating on pulling the trigger for her review.  

My house rules state that only approved guests can stay the night. She told me at booking it would only be her ""at this time"". I'm sure she just didn't read the rules and wasn't intentional about sneaking people in, since there was no difference in price and the way she phrased it, but it still felt pretty icky that she had at least 4 other guests, possibly a 5th. When I messaged her about it, she was apologetic and plead ignorance. She agreed to be more careful about reading rules in the future.  

Then she left the house a mess. Obviously there's extra cleaning for extra people, but all the mirrors had finger prints, there was milk spilled on the stairs, food on the floor, random stuff left behind, blank CDs we left for guests all over the floor etc. She broke a flimsy coat rack, a flimsy plug cover and scratched the paint off a painted table. She left 40$ cash to cover the expense I guess, but no message about the broken items.

This isn't the end of the world but I paid my cleaners 3x the usual for all the extra work and grief (they had to come twice to reset the breaker when they blew it with too many lights/appliances). I get that she tried to make things okay, but I would not be willing to host her again and I want to warn other hosts. Let me know what you think of this review...  I'm hesitating because i don't think anyone else will ever host her again.

GUEST broke our house rules and invited several family members to stay in our home without informing us ahead of time. We discussed this and she apologised, but unfortunately she also left the house quite dirty (milk and food on the floor), broke some items, and scratched the paint off of a table. She reimbursed us for the damage but we would not be willing to host her again.

“Yes. Be there in 10 min.”

“Ok. Because I need to talk with you.”

I get home and the guest already has her bags packed and is sitting on the bed waiting for me.

I immediately discounted the story, because no men have used that bathroom in weeks. I have another long term woman guest who is extremely clean and cleans that bathroom all the time. So I have assumed she planted the pee and was using it to try and get out of the booking. 

She next said that she doesn’t feel comfortable staying here, so I said “No problem. You can leave if you want.”

But a couple of days ago, the doorman said a dozen people showed up asking about how to get to the apartment. It's only a small 2 bedroom apartment, but newly renovated. It makes me sick thinking they cramped that many people inside our renovated and furnished apartment.

I sent the tenant an eviction letter today giving him a one month notice and told him I won't keep his security deposit, so we're treating this as a regular termination of tenancy.

Then I went on the AirBnB website and to my horror, found another two of my apartments on it, but these guys were only renting out a bedroom. So I haven't decided what to do yet. That said, it is illegal here as you need a license to operate a guest house for any rental period less than a month.

We own the entire building, is there anyway I can get AirBnB to blacklist our building? Their service reps weren't being very helpful.

They offered a refund, but my reservation is for over a month and any other place I can book now is 2-3 times the price.

There's actually not really a railing near the top of the staircase, which lead to this catastrophe. 

My guest was carrying her luggage while heading down the staircase, lost her balance, and this 250lb+ woman went tumbling face down the staircase before crashing into a wall.  Blood is everywhere, screaming, huge gash on her head, immediately heads to the hospital. 

She texts me later that day saying that she works in construction and that the staircase railing is not up to code, wasn't there when she lost her footing, needs my landlords information, is looking to sue him, the works. I'm freaked because she could sue me, the landlord, etc. for tens of thousands, my landlord could come after me, maybe the city could come after me, everything is literally fucked.

She tells me her hospital bill amounts to over $1,000, and I'm thinking I might have to just eat this entire bill of hers even though I wasn't at fault (have hosted tons and tons of guests, zero issues) on the hopes that she doesn't sue me/my landlord. 

I called Airbnb and told them the whole story, and even though the accident happened outside my apartment and it was my landlord's fault, they agreed to reimburse for all her medical bills! She agrees and feels satisfied, understands that accidents happen, maybe she should have been more careful. Fuck yes!!! I know maybe everyone doesn't have the best experience, but for me this was a godsend. ",0.96,24,1486742151.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/5t81af/everyone_hates_on_the_host_guarantee_but_i_have_a/,True,11

adb2ebec-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,A warning for those looking to use Airbnb's Referral System,"I referred a host to AirBnB who created a listing and successfully finished her first booking.

I then saw that in my control panel that the referral was deemed as ""Not eligible"" due to ""Booking didn't meet $129 CAD"", despite showing ""Booking complete"".

I dug through AirBnB's [Terms and Conditions](https://www.airbnb.ca/help/article/1129/host-referral-program-t-c---referring-host) and found out why:

>To qualify for any payouts, the Referred Host’s first received booking must have a value excluding cleaning fees, taxes, and special offers) of at least 100 USD (or the equivalent in your local currency). The Referred Host has 150 days from the date they are invited to Complete their first booking in order to earn the Payment.

Maybe you guys already know about this stipulation, but I thought I'd share it here because where I live, the average booking is around $50/day CAD, so unless somebody books for 3+ days on their first booking, I will never see a completed referral.

Kind of lame if you ask me, since Airbnb is gaining a very high value lead: a new host that is earning them money.

**Update: October 15th, 2016**

Today I just received an e-mail from Airbnb regarding a Referral Bonus for $132 CA (for this particular referral). It's a bit odd, too, since I contacted customer support shortly after I posted this thread to which I got a canned response about their rules. According to their rules I shouldn't be eligible for any payment so I'm not sure why I got this... unless they read this thread or something.",1.0,24,1473555203.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/52657x/a_warning_for_those_looking_to_use_airbnbs/,True,9

adb2f1e6-54bd-11ea-8a4b-9cb6d0bc58b0,Entire property rented to two groups?,"Hi all,

I'm not too familiar with Airbnb rules however I have booked a property for my wife and friends to celebrate her party. Originally booked for 16 and i specifically chose a property which was the entire property, a main building and a summer house essentially.

Closer to the time, a few people pulled out and we had only 11 in the end. The girls have turned up and the summer house has been rented out to a group of guys.

This means that the garden sauna and hot tub are now shared, and they don't have private access to the entire property. I've priced it up with 10, 11 and 16 and it's the same price and includes both properties,  so would I be in my right mind to complain? Is this a breach?

I can see why they did it, they can make extra money, but I specifically rented it due to being a private property and not having to share. Can anyone shed any insight into Airbnb rules for false advertising?
Thanks",0.92,22,1573316426.0,/r/AirBnB/comments/dty0nf/entire_property_rented_to_two_groups/,True,39
