I also would've felt bad canceling since I'm the last Uber out at this time in this small market. \\n\\nSo I head on over and hit \\\"Arrived\\\" as I pull into the parking lot, and I see a group of alternative-ish looking young adults having a smoke outside and chatting away, but I'm not sure yet if that's who I'm picking up.

Yeah, call me a pushover, but I've had pretty good luck with the guarantee so far and I didn't want to mess with it. \\n\\nBut then... I look at the clock. It's 2:50 am.

I've never done it before... but I've heard of other drivers doing it.... but I don't want to leave them stranded out here, do I? I turn to look at them. They're still laughing it up, cigarettes in hand, acting as if I wasn't even there. I hit \\\"cancel trip\\\", but wait until 2:51 to hit \\\"rider no show,\\\" just to be safe. Zero turns to one and I hit that button like a trigger happy jarhead, then speed out of the parking lot.

That's what they claim.\\n\\nBut they're not doing that.\\n\\nIf a customer doesn't tip, that 10 mile delivery will pay $6 or $7. They need to pay at least that much to get some poor sap to deliver it. But if the customer puts in a nice tip - let's say the customer tips $10 - then suddenly DD pays you the base pay of $2 again, making the whole order worth $12. They figure the tip is enough - someone will take a 10 mile, $12 order - so they pay you the minimum they can.\\n\\nThat's doing the exact same thing they used to do - using the generosity of the customer to screw their workers out of pay - just much less transparently and now they lie about what they're doing.\\n\\nOn GH (I use GH as an example because I drive for them), they truly let you keep your tips. If the base pay for that order on GH was $7, and someone tipped $10, you get $17 for the job. On DD, the reduce their base pay by $5 because the tip is good, and you get $12. That's money out of your pocket. You might say \\\"well it's good enough, quit complaining\\\" but this all affects your bottom line one way or another. You need those good payouts to make this job work, because there are going to be times when you barely make anything because it's a slow night or because you take a borderline crappy order and the restaurant is really slow and you end up making $5 in 40 minutes and the good offers need to be able to offset that. \\n\\nThis is scummy, unethical behavior. They're sculpting the payouts of their deliveries not based on a consistent system like they claim - time, milage, desirability - but by paying whatever they think the minimum they can get away to get someone to take the order. They're reducing driver pay when the customer is generous.

They took me in a cruiser to where they were holding the suspect, so I could let them know if they got the right guy or not. And I told them that it was for sure him. The officers that were with me told me that they just happened to be down the street when they got the call and that they saw him right away.

The other is the orderly type.  They want to order a pizza from their favorite spot to get delivered home.

Offers to buy me a slice if we stop.  Gets pseudo-offended when I decline her offer.  Other friends not really engaging in that part of conversation.   She even says she'll give me an extra $5 to go back and get a slice after, very intent.  I actually might have stopped for the pizza of course, but I couldn't keep the meter running for 20 min, and couldn't figure out how the fare would work. Since I was their Uber driver afterall!!

They know that people will reject the low and medium value orders if they have an expectation that a high value order is coming if they turn that one down. Hiding the high value orders disincentivizes waiting for a big order, because you can't actually see what a big order might be until you've completed it, which they hope will make you take more low and medium value orders in the hopes that there's a surprise tip at the end.\\n\\nYou can't make informed decisions about what jobs to take or not if you're not given the true information about the job up front. Maybe that tip is big because it's a long drive or a shitty neighborhood or a difficult apartment complex. I might reject that job if I'm getting offered $7, but would take it if I saw the true value of the order (14). Any time DD causes us to make the wrong decision because of their attempt at psychological manipulation hurts us.\\n\\nIt's unfair to the customer.

I\\u2019ll just wait outside the nail salon for you and drive you back home.\\u201d I live 20 minutes from their house, this is going to be my greatest score ever in 3 years doing this shit job!!!!\\n\\nSo the guy says \\u201cyou would do that? I\\u2019ve never had an Uber driver offer that!\\u201d. I said, \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m not going to be able to get Uber requests up in Wisconsin anyway. Uber doesn\\u2019t give Illinois drivers requests up there (Lyft does, but with this score I didn\\u2019t say anything) so I\\u2019m going to have to drive back across the border to get more requests anyway.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWait, what do you mean Wisconsin??\\u201d He says.\\n\\u201cEmil\\u2019s Pizza, right?\\u201d I said. At this point I had the address in Google Maps, and gave it to him.\\n\\n\\u201cOh Holy fuck. Who would have thought there\\u2019s another Emil\\u2019s Pizza! I picked the wrong one! I just updated the app!\\u201d\\n\\nNow my trip is 1.9 miles for a whopping $2.80!!\\n\\nSo I drop his wife off at the nail salon down the street after listening to them arguing the entire way. Then we get to the pizza place and he asks \\u201care you going to go back to the nail salon and wait for my wife?\\u201d Before I could scream \\u201cGET THE FUCK OUT OF MY CAR!\\u201d, Lyft queued me up another trip. \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m sorry sir, I have another ride already, see? I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d \\u201cOh well, it\\u2019s OK. I\\u2019ll throw you a nice tip on the app for all the confusion and bickering\\u201d he says.\\n\\nThe rider Lyft queued me was a 327 pound Indian woman who smelled like she just cooked 10 pounds of chicken curry.

Grubhub sucks. Here are my grudges. Happy 4th. (Wall of words)\", \"text\": \"I started with OrderUp in the Spring of 2015, and was absorbed into Grubhub in October of 2017, I believe.  OrderUp was a dream. Grubhub is not. I feel as though I have a very strong knowledge of both delivery processes and the market my city occupies (Nashville, if it helps). We are not a *super* busy market, and though I work full-time (50+ hours, actually), I generally end up relying on the minimum pay as orders are rarely of sufficient volume to break it. I would like to share my opinions and experiences, starting with today (which fed me up).\\n\\nThis morning I woke up to start my 8-12 shift and signed on. Similar to a post I saw lower in the subreddit, I was not receiving orders and soon realized I was indeed *not* signed on, and my entire block was dropped. Fine. Needing money, I took a 11-2 shift before my 3-7. First order is Subway, but they're closed once I arrived (even though it had been confirmed?). Fine, call it in and they cancel it. I check my pay summary and have a missed order. I shouldn't, as after my shift was dropped, I kept a strict eye on my app. Called Driver Support again, and apparently I had missed the order somehow once before I actually managed to accept it. Despite the fact the restaurant was closed, and I DID in fact accept it (albeit - apparently - the second time around), there is nothing but one missed order on my pay summary. I was even assigned a second order (which was confirmed halfway there) only to arrive to a closed restaurant. Only one missed order, zero accepted orders. I have made no money today.\\n\\nI'm feeling pretty unappreciated and emailed Driver Pay nearly demanding they pay me $33 for the three hour shift - no way I'm going to work my 3-7 on the Fourth of July with such a precarious start to the day. As I'm feeling so beaten up by Grubhub, I thought I would share my collected list of gripes I have against the company as a driver. I would love to hear some of your experiences, and if you agree or disagree with any of my notes. Beware: boring list ahead.\\n\\n**Shifts are not easily stacked with half hour increments \\u201coverlapping\\u201d any convenient options**\\n\\nFull order details are not shared with us \\u2013 Why won\\u2019t you tell us what the drink is? Or what side they ordered?\\n\\n**Grubhub confirms orders without the restaurant\\u2019s confirmation \\u2013 this happened twice to me today (the 4th of July) and I learned it\\u2019s called something to the effect of \\u201cNon-confirmation override\\u201d**\\n\\nRegion boundaries are not clear; I deliver outside the boundaries often but get conflicting answers on whether this is proper or not. Receiving texts saying \\u201cRETURN TO THE ZONE\\u201d indicates to me something is wrong, yet is not remedied.\\n\\n**App updates don\\u2019t provide information about what they changed, every update simply says \\u201cWe have taken your suggestions into consideration\\u201d or something to that effect. In addition, it seems as if some feature is consistently knocked off with each update. Customer last names disappeared (understandable but unhelpful, and also not announced, it simply happened), ability to reject orders in-app, etc. have been recent lost features.**\\n\\nI\\u2019m swung from corner to corner of our delivery zone. A 15, or even 10, minute drive from a dropoff to the next restaurant is absurd and not included in the gas fees they pay us. Drives between orders are often where most of my gas goes anyway.\\n\\n**Driver Support is far too difficult to reach**\\n\\nWe can\\u2019t reject orders without calling Driver Care anymore?\\n\\n**The app and system itself is glitch-ridden**\\n\\nDriver Support says they cannot undo \\u2018Missed\\u2019 or \\u2018Rejected\\u2019 orders, even if they are in error. Despite being in an open location, a few days ago I couldn\\u2019t acquire connection, leading me to be unable to accept an order. I contacted support who assured me it must have been my phone, and that the missed order will remain to not only cut into my acceptance score for the day, but my driver rating for acquiring new shifts.\\n\\n**Why is texting the customer (or better yet, Driver Support) not a primary option? Calling is not always convenient.**\\n\\nThe dispatch is inconsistent. They send me additional orders before I have completed my first. This is bad for two reasons:\\n\\n\\\\- I\\u2019m often nearing a customer while driving but need my GPS/delivery info. To attempt to accept an order while moving is both unsafe and unhelpful to the order at hand. Similarly, and arguably more frustrating, is calling a customer (usually upon their request) only to hear the horrid cowbell and have to juggle your phone through several apps, while a customer is on the line.\\n\\n\\\\- If you assign additional orders to drivers prematurely/predelivery, you are assuming preemptively that that driver will be the closest to the following restaurant. However, even five minutes can make a difference of the location of drivers around the city. Assigning me an order, before I\\u2019ve delivered another, to across town makes no sense when if dispatch waited even mere moments, a more convenient driver could become available.\\n\\n\\\\- *I don\\u2019t know if dispatch is entirely automated or has a human touch, but it often seems (or at least feels) quite deliberate.*\\n\\n**I believe Grubhub wants to keep its costs as low as possible \\u2013 fair enough, right? However, I believe it is at the expense of drivers:**\\n\\n**- The recent lawsuit about ghosted orders feels very familiar. I hadn't received one in some months until today with my missed Subway order, but when I began in October (after years of OrderUp, who was absorbed by GH) it was a common occurrence.**\\n\\n**- My market, Nashville, is slow. I understand it is not one of the raging markets. However, I rarely make more than floor pay, working at least 6 hours every day, if not 8 on weekdays. It would be fair for them to spread orders out to all drivers who have taken shifts (before non-shifted drivers) but I\\u2019m confident they strategically dispatch orders in accordance to the amount of \\u201cGrubhub Contribution\\u201d you have received thus far in the day.**\\n\\n\\\\- **Say I\\u2019ve worked two hours and am ahead of \\u201cfloor pay\\u201d by $2, meaning in my market, I\\u2019ve made $24. I am under the impression they will freeze me from getting orders until ALL drivers have, or are as close to, $0 Grubhub Contribution as possible. This**** sou****nds fair - we all need orders! However, if none of us are making more than floor, and Grubhub is distributing orders evenly to keep from paying their own money in contributions, there is a key aspect of dispatch missi****n**g.\\n\\n\\\\- **Dispatch should be based on nothing more than proximity to the restaurant and, perhaps, how much time you have left in your shift. How much money you have made should frankly be irrelevant, especially if you are signed up to blocks/shifts. That is what the minimum payment is for. Those closest to restaurants should, both technically and, in my opinion, sensibly receive the orders closest to them and without consideration of pay. Don\\u2019t send me from East Nashville to West simply because I haven\\u2019t made enough to cover GH\\u2019s minimum payment.**\\n\\nI have never had a responsive contact with whom to communicate issues within Grubhub (my driver specialist is not helpful; I am trying to acquire his job, hahaha)\\n\\n**Simply because I came from OrderUp, the whole \\u201c$11 an hour plus keep your tips!\\u201d seems as close to deceptive marketing as you can get. OrderUp truly paid us hourly. Each hour was its own measurement, meaning if we made more than $11 in one hour (actually $12 at the time), it stayed intact and was not applied to your earnings for the whole day, whereas with Grubhub, you can make $44 your first shifted hour, then have no orders for your remaining three, and still only make $44. OrderUp would have paid us the $44, then an additional $11 (or 12) for each hour afterward, making the total $77.**\\n\\n**- I understand this is possibly why OrderUp was absorbed by Grubhub \\u2013 they couldn\\u2019t maintain such a payscale. However, I hope it\\u2019s understandable that the way they phrase their pay is not equivalent to other delivery services. I would generally make at least an extra $100-200 a week with OrderUp. Based on a point above, though, I\\u2019m not surprised Grubhub tries to pay as little \\u201cContribution\\u201d as possible, and setting the hourly pay up as OrderUp did would cost them more (though we deserve it).**\\n\\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading and letting me air my grievances. I have reached out to a variety of employees at Grubhub wishing to converse with them about particular items on this list but have never made contact with an employee who is willing to dive deep with me on the issues. I love being a delivery driver, and want Grubhub to be the best it can be. Unfortunately, I feel there are a variety of obstacles keeping Grubhub from being in driver's best (or my good) graces.\\n\\nI would love to hear your thoughts and experiences.\", \"polarity\": 0.08830008156095111, \"subjectivity\": 0.5282403224794527}, {\"title\": \"Rider tried a scam\", \"text\": \"Here is what happened and how scam works.\\n\\n1.

Do you really have to give a low rating to someone because you had to wait 2 minutes outside of the bar for them while they gather their drunk friends together or had to take a piss?  Shit happens.  Be flexible, be understandable, and be a human that operates off more than the \\\"get the fuck in my car right when I pull up, shut up, don't ask for anything, get the fuck out\\\".  Just be chill and act like a goddamn human.  \\n\\nLast night 4 drunk dudes asked to stop at arbys.  I had no problem with it and was completely cool about it, and joked with them the entire time like I was one of the guys.  It was only a $5 trip, but they tipped me $15 and mozzarella sticks and even invited me to party with them the rest of the night.  Your personality often earns your tip more so than the service does.  Cut the water, candy, mints, cologne, back rub, hand job, blow job offerings.  Just drive and be human.  \\n\\nGet a different gig if you expect to make money being a robot.  Good luck.\\n\\nRant over.  \\n\\nEdit:  Thank you for the gold!\", \"polarity\": 0.00466194684944685, \"subjectivity\": 0.5235224266474268}, {\"title\": \"Officially retiring from ridesharing! It was a blast - wish you all the best, and I'll tip you in the app!\", \"text\": \"I only posted in this sub once in a while, but consistently lurked.  I enjoyed reading about your experiences, advice, gripes, and humor.  I only drove as a moonlighting gig, for a few hours in the evenings on weekdays but mostly on weekends.  I have a full-time career, and only intended to use ridesharing as a means for either buying cryptocurrencies (ie, bitcoin and the like), vacation fun money, and some needed car repairs.  After all this time in ridesharing, here's some of the insights I've gleamed:\\n\\n* It took me way too long to get set up using both lyft and uber.  My best paying weekends were always when I was bouncing between the two, and maximizing having passengers rather than pursuing quests.  Pretty soon I became a pro at flipping between the two apps while pinging for passengers. But I wish I'd thought to do that right from the get-go.  I'd have loved to try and do Via as well further maximize available options, but they wouldn't accept my car (2005 civic, they only accept 2006 and newer).\\n\\n* If you have Sirius XM, the best channel for late Friday & Saturday nights is The Coffeehouse (the acoustic soft covers station).  It calms the drunks right down.  Whenever I get various covens of sorority girls screaming to one another in my car, all I have to do is turn that station on, and Norah Jones shuts them right up.\\n\\n* If you miss a turn, and there's even a remote chance that your passenger noticed, then let them know. Just saying, \\\"Ack, sorry I missed that turn\\\" goes a long way. Otherwise they're going to think you're intentionally trying to prolong the drive (they don't know the time contribution is only 12cents per minute). \\n\\n* Keep little gardening pales in your car. If a driver seems hung-over or drunk, have them keep the bucket on their lap.  I've had MANY pax throw up in my car (especially St Patricks day here in Chicago). Yet I've never had to clean up anything, and no damage to my upholstry.  Plus the passenger gets a free bucket.\\n\\n* Don't go to the airport wait lot after dropping someone off (unless the apps show single-digit que). Just accept it as a dead-head and get back to town.\\n\\n* This job became significantly less stressful when I began declining all pool/line requests.  Which I'd started that sooner.\\n\\n* You're rating and cancelation rate really are irrelevant.  It took me a long time to start ignoring those.\\n\\n* You'll be a lot more \\\"at peace\\\" if you just accept a few fundamentals: Pax believe that for their $30 ride, you get $29 and Uber gets $1.  They have no idea you only get $12.  Also, you're dealing with the public. Some of them are 1-star-giving machines, that were born rude and will die rude.  I'll admit, the first time I got a 1-star, or was spoken down-to by a pax, it got to me.  After a while, that shit just brushes right off.  \\n\\n\\nI know this sub beats up on Uber a lot for their various practices, but I'm very grateful that this option was available.  The money I made gave me the opportunity to make some risky purchases I otherwise would have shyed away from.  If I'm ever between jobs or something comes up, I wouldn't hesitate to hop back in the drivers seat, but for the time being I'ma spend my free time on other pursuits.

As usual, traffic leaving staging is backed up, but it\\u2019s moving better than it normally did. Of course, impatient pax is impatient. I\\u2019ll skip the play by play here, but she does the normal \\u201cWhere *are* you?\\u201d with an added twinge of attitude for good measure. Ugh, bad sign, but I continue. I get to the terminal and find a woman and a guy walking up to me. After verifying we were there for each other, she puts her bag in and then sits down, leaving the guy and myself at the back of the car. (PG for pax guy, PB for pax woman)\\n\\nPG - Umm, so we\\u2019ve got two dogs that we need to pick up. They\\u2019re small and we\\u2019ll hold them on our laps. \\n\\nM - Sorry, I don\\u2019t do dogs. <close trunk and sit down>\\n\\nPG - Yeah, he says he won\\u2019t pick up the dogs. \\n\\nPB - (talking to me) Oh yes you **WILL**. They\\u2019re **REGISTERED** service dogs, so you **HAVE** to take them. \\n\\n(Again, just to be clear, there are **NO** dogs with them. The dogs are at another location)\\n\\nM - <sigh> Ok ma\\u2019am, in accordance with federal law, I am able to ask only two questions, one of them being this, what is the dog trained to do?\\n\\nPB - **YOU CAN\\u2019T ASK ANY QUESTIONS!! THAT\\u2019S ILLEGAL!! YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM!!**\\n\\nM - Ma\\u2019am, it is *not* illegal. As laid out in the ADA, I can ask only two specific questions, 1) Is the animal a *service* animal? and 2) What is the animal trained to do? If you want your animals to be accepted as a valid service animal, you need to answer those two questions, and *only* those two questions. That, ma\\u2019am, is the law. \\n\\nPB - **YOU CAN\\u2019T ASK ANYTHING!! THAT\\u2019S ILLEGAL!!\\n\\nM - Whelp, that\\u2019s enough. Get out. The ride is cancelled. And just to be clear, I am **NOT** cancelling because of a service animal, I am cancelling because of your attitude. Get. Out. \\n\\nPB - NO!! I am **NOT** getting out!!\\n\\nM - If you don\\u2019t get out, I\\u2019m calling the cops to *help* you get out. \\n\\nAt this point I get out, open the trunk, and then sit back down and cancel the ride. Evidently dude was used to her behavior because he\\u2019s already got his bags out of the trunk and is standing at the door. \\n\\nPG - C\\u2019mon, you need to get out. \\n\\nPB - No! I\\u2019m not going anywhere!\\n\\nPG - He\\u2019s gonna call the cops on you if you don\\u2019t. \\n\\nPB - I don\\u2019t care. I am **NOT** getting out! I\\u2019m gonna waste this guys time!\\n\\nI grab my phone from the mount and unplug it. I take a quick look around to see where everyone is. PB is still sitting behind me, but PG is *GONE**. All I can see is a cloud of dust behind this guy half way down the terminal. He is literally running away. So much for chivalry.....\\n\\nM - Ma\\u2019am, last chance. Are you getting out?\\n\\nPB - **NO!!**\\n\\nSo I dial 911 and wait. By the time they answered, PB decided that she really didn\\u2019t want to play this game anymore and grabbed her crap and left.

Forced week off from driving but my day job has been busy so did not miss that much.  Anyway, its good to see things from the riders perspective.  \\n\\nApp Issues- Everything they tell us is true.  If I request to my correct address it takes them one block south.  So I request to Quizno's nearby. I manually enter the Quizno's for each trip, an extra step most riders are not going to bother with.    The app does not update for them.  Just as we have to force quit & re-open to get accurate sticky surge info, the rider app will hang at 8 min away and then suddenly the driver is at the curb.  I suspect this is why many pax cancel when we are actually close to picking them up.  So if you really want that surge trip, msg them en route.\\n\\nTipping- The app offers fixed tips up to $5 for short trips.  For longs it offers percentage up to 25%.  That is why we receive $3.31 tips.  It makes sense to me as a $2 tip on a $50 trip is ridiculous, maybe the percentages will bring up the tip amounts.  I tipped in cash unless I had run out, then I would show the driver as I tipped them on the app so they would know before they rated me.\\n\\nIncurious/No habla Drivers- The day drivers I met were characterized by an initiative deficit.  One comes in from an hour away to drive 4 days a week and considered $15/hour gross decent.  He just takes stacked trips totally ignoring surge opportunities.  I showed him how to stop new requests.  Also, most don't even sign up for Lyft, have no idea you can snag prime trips from the airport where Uber does not surge here.  About 25% of drivers here in Des Moines don't speak a lick of English.

I got a ping to an apartment complex, so I go to where she drops the pin. I wait a minute and call to ask where she wants me to pick her up. \\u201cOh it\\u2019s in the apartment complex across the street, the GPS just sends you there.\\u201d. Clearly this happened before, and she still didn\\u2019t change the address, or give some sort of heads up. Strike one.\\n\\nAgainst my better judgement, I go to the apartment complex across the street and it\\u2019s a gated community. I call again and get the code. \\u201cOh yeah it\\u2019s xxxx\\u201d she says, then promptly hangs up. No heads up, no apologies. Strike two.\\n\\nAt this point, I\\u2019m well within my right to cancel. Against my better judgement, I pick up the pax. She\\u2019s a young woman. Clearly entitled, clearly obsessed with her phone. The ride was a good 7-8 miles down PCH so it\\u2019s a decent fare. She gets in, I greet her, she says \\u201cgood\\u201d. That is now my cue to leave the pax alone, but I really didn\\u2019t follow it back then. She\\u2019s going to some nice restaurant, so I ask her \\u201coh wow, what\\u2019s the occasion?\\u201d and she just starts talking, telling me how it\\u2019s her brother\\u2019s college graduation dinner, and how she feels overshadowed by her brother in every way.  I give her a little pep talk and we\\u2019re at the destination at this point. \\n\\nShe gets out, but not before handing me a 20 DOLLAR TIP. I\\u2019m floored, I didn\\u2019t see that coming; not with her rating , not with her demeanor. \\u201cThanks for listening. That\\u2019s the first time I really felt heard in a while\\u201d, she tells me.\\n\\nI still think about her every now and then. I\\u2019d never take a pax with that low a rating at night anymore, male or female, but I really lucked out on that one.\", \"polarity\": 0.11240379990379994, \"subjectivity\": 0.3815536315536315}, {\"title\": \"For anyone wondering about 4/20 tips today...\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"title\": \"Very next order after the wait 10 minutes for no tip while he brags about money guy.

Total ride payments - This is what you were paid out for ride payments (including primetime minus tolls minus lyft commission). Cancel fees, bonuses, referral are NOT in here.  \\n2. Gross ride payments - this is ride fare paid by the pax. This is the mile+time cost (including primetime costs) which we get our pay (minus Lyft commission). This is the total number reported on your 1099-K (your ride pay + Lyft commission).  \\n3. Lyft Commission - this is how much Lyft took from the payments. This is not in the 1099-K anywhere. You should add this to your tax deductions as you shouldn't pay taxes on this amount.  \\n4. Tolls - Amount paid by Lyft to you for tolls via pax. Again, this should be a deduction on your taxes since it's an expense for the work done. I maintain my own tolls expense sheet which is more than what Lyft pays me as I have to pay return tolls occasionally. This is also not on the 1099-K  \\n5. Total Non-ride payments - this is where cancel fees, referral payouts, tips, bonuses are listed. Basically, anything you get money for that is not associated with a specific ride. If this is over $600 you get a 1099-MISC.  \\n6. Total miles in/out of rides - This is Lyft's calculation of your mileage, but I maintain my own log of miles as it always comes out to be a bit more as the app doesn't count miles when you are in destination mode or offline going somewhere.  \\n  \\nThe second image is from TurboTax on the other expenses page where you would add the Lyft commissions as a deduction.

Anyway here\\u2019s some things that I do or have done:\\n\\n1. I\\u2019ll make an unscheduled stop for a pax (like a gas station or fast food) if it\\u2019s directly on the way. One guy asked me if we could stop at the Taco Bell ahead so he could go in. Another wanted me to stop at the gas station at the corner to grab something.  Both times it only took a couple of minutes \\n\\n2. I don\\u2019t change the app\\u2019s auto rating. Every pax gets 5 stars whether they Tipp me or not, whether it\\u2019s a short or long ride. Whether they talk or don\\u2019t talk. Only time I\\u2019ve ever given someone a 1 star was because she was a total bitch\\n\\n3. I accept every ride. I only declined one ride so far and that was a total accident (1st day). I don\\u2019t pay much attention to the pax rating. I guess I usually forget to look at it\\n\\n4. I let people eat and drink in my car. Made a scheduled stop for one guy to pick up his pizza and after he got back in the car he asked me if he could have a slice. Who am I to hold a man back from his pizza?\\n\\n5. I wait for people for more than 5 minutes. One time I waited at a dollar general store cause they got a couple of things. Another time at a loan place. The longest I\\u2019ve waited was a scheduled stop at a pawn shop. I think it was something around 30 mins. I admit I was getting pissed but overall the ride made my night money wise & he gave me a generous cash tip\\n\\n6. I\\u2019ll go out of my way to pick up a pax. Every once in a while I\\u2019ll arrive at the pick up location, just for the pax not be there but actually on the other side of the street or around the corner (technically always within walking distance of them). Just the other day I arrived at the pickup spot. Pax not here. Called. They told me they were actually across the street at the entrance of a hotel (they saw me drive past them). It was downtown Nashville & the street was super busy so I feel like they could\\u2019ve used the crosswalk to come to me instead of me navigating through traffic just to make it across the street to the valet entrance of the hotel. Another time, again I arrived at the pickup spot. Pax not here. But saw on the map that pax was actually 2 blocks away (how did he enter a completely wrong address???) Anyway I told him to stay put and I\\u2019ll try to make it there. By this time the 5 minute wait time was up. Then pax cancelled the ride. So at least I got some money out of it. But I was genuinely trying to pick him up.\\n\\nI should also mention that I live in a relatively small town (~150,000) and only drive in a large city on the weekend. I don\\u2019t really have the freedom to decline rides when I want to because there just aren\\u2019t simply enough rides during the week.

I get pulled over, throw it into park, and turn on the light to see that there is a decent size amount of puke on my back floor. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNot helping the matter is that he didn't open the door or lean out the window further. Nope, he just rested his head on the ledge of the window and puked down the side of my car (luckily the window doesn't go all the way down and it didn't drip down inside the door).

I don't know what his plan was because he didn't come fists-a-flyin or put up a block because I turn in my seat and give him a few kicks to the gut (would have been fun if I hit his nuts, but then again might have made the situation worse).

He said I have to give him a ride again. I told him to back the f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* away from my vehicle because he isn't my passenger anymore and will not be getting back into my car.

I look at the details and sure enough it was a $6 tip for this ride.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter photos were taken I got to cleaning up the bulky stuff with some gas station paper towels and pull the small carpet out. It was a 45 minute drive home but we have cats that puke / have hairballs so thankfully our carpet cleaning supplies aren't lacking.

See you shortly!\\\"\\n\\nSo why did I title this post \\\"Quickie tips for  black male food couriers?\\\" Well, it's because many of my customers are scared to death of big black men. If you are a big, black food courier you have got to deal with that. Even if you are white a lot of my tips apply.  I can't emphasize enough the importance of gratuities, as most veterans here already know. *My goal is to make my customers pleased enough with my service that they tip me graciously.* Without that generosity I could not justify being a food courier.\\n\\nTo get the highest gratuities you have to deliver on the customer service front, regardless of your race. If you are African-American you have to do even better. Hey, I'm not hating here. I'm just telling you what it is. Look, when I ring the doorbell I'm already grinning ear to ear. I just assume I am being captured on video. \\n\\nThen, when the door opens, it's show time. I address the customer by name and tell a little story about their order: \\\"Ma'am, you would not believe the stories I am hearing about these wings. Is this your first time trying them?\\\" \\n\\nSo I will wrap this by saying customer service is job one, no matter if you are black, white, brown, or something else.\\n\\nStay safe, and have fun out there.\", \"polarity\": 0.13511904761904764, \"subjectivity\": 0.37023809523809526}, {\"title\": \"Suspicious decrease in tips for Caviar in the last 3 days?\", \"text\": \"Odds are high that someone has had a rough few days as well, but I say \\\"suspicious\\\" because I'm getting <$1 per tip which has basically never happened for me and is sketchier than no tip.

Bills get payed, and my partner and I get to go out and have fun from time to time, but the reality is, this can't go on any longer.\\n\\nI'm writing this hoping that new drivers will take heed, and current drivers can relate. The personal freedom that this job gives is pretty awesome. I went from a salaried corporate chef job, working as much as 70 hours/per week, with a work/life ratio that was anytbing but balanced. And my weekends were plagued with the threat of webinars, conference calls, and emails that needed to be answered immediately. It stole my passion for cooking, gave me panic attacks, and I barely saw my partner at all, if ever. To top it all of, the money wasn't that great. The benefits package was superior, but I felt like it was more like a bribe than anything else. \\n\\nI quit, without hesitation, after several years. \\n\\nRidesharing seemed like the best option, and it was a good idea at the time. The schedule flexibility allowed me time at home when I needed it, I went out and saw friends more, and my panic attacks subsided considerably. \\n\\nI made my own set of rules over the first few weeks as a driver, which have generally served me well:\\n\\n-I gave myself monetary goals, not time constraints, i.e. I make $125 at least before going home, instead of telling myself I'll only stay out for 8-10 hours. Some days sucked more than others, but that's par for the course.\\n\\n-I don't travel more than 5-6 miles to pick up a pax, unless it's a 45+ minute trip. \\n\\n-I try not to drive more than a couple of miles to find a good spot to wait for my next ping. I like chain gas stations, like Racetrac or QT as a waiting spot. Clean bathrooms, decent coffee if I need it, and, if it's late at night, there's usually law enforcement nearby, so there's a sensation of safety.\\n\\n-I never purposefully drove to an event, the airport, or a designated area that's experiencing a surge. I live in Atlanta, where everything is so spread out, and the traffic is some of the worst in the country. Driving to a specific location is just wasted miles/\\\"deadheading\\\". \\n\\n-and finally, I top off my tank at the gas station that's only a mile from my house, so I can get in my car the next morning,  turn on the apps, and sit in my driveway unyil I get my first ping.\\n\\nEveryone does this job for different reasons, I know that. But I hope by sharing these details about how I handle this job from day to day, I hope that it might help your work day be a little smoother. If you're  a new driver, or thinking about starting, or going from part- to full-time, this will help you make a more informed decision.\\n\\nAs I said earlier, bills are getting paid, and I have enough money leftover for some fun. But there is little to know money leftover, so I'm not able to save.\\n\\nI'm starting the process of getting my real estate licence, mainly because the potential to make money is high. A close friend of mine, who is in the real estate business, turned me onto it after hearing a similar rant. I want to be able to travel more, rekindle some old hobbies of mine, start some creative projects that have been on the \\\"back burner\\\" for years, and live life without the stresses that come with making so little money. It's no secret tjat ridesharing is no longer a viable full-time job. My car has sustained damage from doing this job; I got into a minor accident on the way to pick up a pax, wich still hasn't been repaired since it happened over a month ago. I just can't justify the wear and tear on my car anymore. \\n\\nNot to mention, these are both large companies. And in my mind, that means they care precious little about the employees, and more about the customers. I've had a lot of corporate experienc, and this rings true with me, regardless of the company.\\n\\nAnyways, rant/speach over. Uber and Lyft, it hasn't been very fun, and in the end, you can both go fuck yourselves.

I have been an Uber driver in Colorado Springs for over 3 years now.  This passenger is one of my go to stories for \\\"crazy passengers\\\".  So it was winter of 2017 and the end of a weekend night around 2:30 a.m. after the bars had been close for 30 minutes.  I decided to take one more ride before the end of the night.  I get my last fair and its a pick up behind a restaurant on the northeast side of town.  \\n\\nI pull up behind the restaurant and there is a black car waiting.  As I stop the driver of the car gets out and begins to help his buddy out of the car.  The guy helps him into the back seat thanks me and gives me a small cash tip asking me to get him home safely.  This isn't an uncommon happening I get at least 3 or 4 rides a week were a buddy orders his extremely drunk friend a ride home.  This ride was going to be a decent one, 10 miles on a small surge.  A good $20 in the pocket.\\n\\nWell the first 5 to 10 minutes of the ride was uneventful because DG was passed out hard.  It all changed as DG woke up in the back.  \\n\\nDG: \\\\*take off his shoes in the back seat\\\\* \\\"You know what man don't worry I'll order an Uber.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"It ok man, my name is OP, I am your Uber driver. Your buddy ordered this for you.\\\"\\n\\nDG: \\\"No no man don't worry I'll order an Uber.\\\" \\n\\nMe: \\\\*Ignoring him at this point\\\\*\\n\\nDG: \\\\*Opens the rear passenger door\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAt this point I was freaking out. I am driving at 70mph (112kph for you none USA) down a road with no lights.  I yell at him to close the door but he moves to step out. So I reached back with my right arm and grabbed the guy by his shirt collar and held him as a came to a stop.   I was furious at this point I get out and move around the car but the guy is passed out already in the back seat again.  I was honestly tempted to leave him on the side of the street but it was very cold out that night.  I close his door all the way and continue down the road.  \\n\\nThe rest trip was fine until I get to his home which is in a heavily treed area called black forest.  I pull up to the front of his driveway and it haw a cattle gate at the front.  I grumble as I get out of the car to open the gate and as I close my door I hear my passenger get out of the car.  I look over and watch him fall in the ditch next to the road. Before I can even go to try and help DG he is up and is running for his homes gate.  I watched as he ran full speed into his gate struggle to his feet open his gate and run for his house.  At this point I was going to leave but DG left his shoes, socks, wallet and watch in the rear seat.  So I drive up his driveway, get out throw his stuff through the front door he left open and leave as his dog barks at me for being on his property.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo to finish up this story a few days ago I had a pick up request out in Black Forest.  I don't think much of it till I see this guy's front gate and him waiting by it.  He gets into the car and we do the regular small talk.  At this point I don't know if it is really him.  Then the Conversation goes like this. \\n\\nMe: \\\"How long have you lived here?\\\"\\n\\nG: \\\"About 4 years.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Do you have any room mates?\\\"  (I'm asking rather creeper like questions now)\\n\\nG: \\\"No, just me and my dogs.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"I think I have driven you before.  It was pretty memorable.\\\"\\n\\nG:  \\\"I tried to jump out of your car didn't I?\\\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAt this point we talk for a while about it. At the end of the ride guy thanks me for getting him home safely that night and gives me a nice tip.    It is one of my favorite stories to tell and now It has a different ending. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR:  Pick up a drunk guy who tries to jump out of my car while traveling 70mph and I end up picking him up again 2 years later and he remembered that night but not me. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n*EDIT* Thank you all for the great responses and the gold!\", \"polarity\": 0.054771164021164005, \"subjectivity\": 0.4805346967846968}, {\"title\": \"Wrong address and you have a train to catch?

I had maybe four or five blocks to go before I drop him off, and was considering my options.  \\n\\nIt was at that point that I began to question my very manhood (I'm not joking, I was seriously going over this in my head) allowing this to continue, and on top of that, it starts to dawn on me that this dude is probably being as bold as he is because I'm a white male, and he's probably assuming that I will agree (or at a minimum, not interfere) with his racist bullshit.\\n\\nThen the Thought of \\\"oh fuck me, I'm about to be \\\"THAT\\\" guy. That guy that I swore to myself I would never be, I am being it right now.\\\" \\\"THAT GUY\\\" is That (worthless, piece of crap) guy or person who is physically present while some seriously wrong/racist/violent shit is going on right in front of them, and they either don't care (not my case obviously) or bitch up and don't say or do shit.\\n\\nTHAT thought snap me out of it, and I immediately turned around and told him to leave her alone and shut the fuck up (paraphrasing).  Initially he said some shit about reporting me and about getting out of the car, and as soon as those words escaped his lips I came to a screeching halt in the middle of the road and said get the fuck out. He started to back off a little bit, but I'm pissed now and the adrenaline is flowing so I'm like nah man get the fuck out of my car before shit escalates.   Surprisingly, he continued to apologize and basically nearly begged me to take him the last three or four blocks and drop them off. To be perfectly honest, I wanted to get out and fight. Been a long time since I've scrapped and boy do I have some pent-up aggression, but I'm also on the job and that's not professional, Plus I can only imagine how much more uncomfortable and how much more frightened that poor lady would have been if I escalated it further, so I drove down the street and dropped him off.  \\n\\nI spent the rest of the ride apologizing to her for not acting sooner.\\n\\nI'm really just relaying the experience, and the fact that I finally have a THAT story of my own, but in a way I'm glad it happened. It's one of those things where you wonder how you would react in a dangerous situation, when you're watching someone else react poorly on a video or something. You swear to yourself you would do it differently, but until the situation arises you really never know.\\n\\nI stood up for someone who wasn't me, wasn't related to me and I'll never see again.  I did it for no other reason than it was the right thing to do - could have easily let it go, or even joined in which would have made MY situation a lot less uncomfortable.... I stood up to racism and general asshole-ism.  I was ready to scrap if scrapping needed to happen, but I also ended up resolving the situation without violence.   So much WINNING!  \\n\\nSome are going to read that and comment about me patting myself on the back, and to those I say \\ud83d\\udd95\\ud83d\\udd95.  I was tested, and aside from allowing something to go on for 4 minutes longer than I should have, I passed the (my own) test.  I represented both white people and males everywhere respectfully I hope, and I hope that at least she walked away from this a little more hopeful about the generosity of strangers and community in general - maybe even her perception of white males is a little better too.... I hope so.  I didn't let bad deeds go unaddressed in my presence. \\n\\nNot gonna lie;  I am proud of me.  Score one for the good guys \\ud83d\\ude0e\\ud83d\\udc4d    now just gotta work this adrenaline out, Jesus Flippin CHRIST  I'm jacked up. \\n\\n\\nAnd yep, I have the whole thing on video.  \\n\\nAs an aside, that is easily the most intense racism I've ever experienced in person in real life.

They keep raising your costs - and then tell you to drive 50+ hrs a week to make shit money after expenses and be happy about it.\\n\\nOn a separate note someone correct me if I'm doing this wrong but my way to 'get back' at Lyft is to just complete the ride minimum and write off the vehicle during taxes (got two other jobs).
