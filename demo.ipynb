And this has worked out generally for the most part\\n\\nI\\u2019m now pushing 30 and I\\u2019m trying my best to still live by this mentality, but rideshare has made it increasingly difficult. My pax have proven to me that indeed stereotypes are not always true, but on the converse some have also proven that they DO exist. \\n\\nRemember I\\u2019m a driver in Las Vegas so I see ALL kinds of people of various nationalities, races etc\\n\\nIndian people, some don\\u2019t stink, but most of them do. And the ones who do tell me to turn the ac off. Fuck you its 105 degrees outside and your bo is pungent enough as it is\\n\\nNext are my own kind (white people) they\\u2019re generally a mixed bag. They\\u2019re either super cool and tip well (midwesterners) or they think that because I\\u2019m a rideshare driver I\\u2019m somehow beneath them and they won\\u2019t say a word, be entitled, demanding, and not tip. \\n\\nNext are Latinos. Most are pretty cool, some are ghetto cholo/chola trash. Either way I know I\\u2019m not getting tipped. Latinos have proven to be even worse than Asians and Indians when it comes to stiffing their driver\\n\\nAsians can\\u2019t handle their alcohol, plain and simple. Over 3000 rides between both apps and the one person who puked in my car was an Asian. I know others puke from drinking too but rideshare aside, when I\\u2019ve gone out I always see Asian people puking from drinking too much. If they\\u2019re sober, they\\u2019re usually pretty chill, but sober or drunk, I\\u2019m not getting tipped. I also wouldn\\u2019t know where to begin telling you how many times I\\u2019ve had to help Asian (usually female pax) out my car because they\\u2019re too drunk to stand, let alone speak \\n\\nNext are African Americans....sigh...probably the biggest variance of people I\\u2019ve had. Some of my best tips have come from African American pax, as have some of my best rides. The biggest drawback though, is they\\u2019re notorious for requesting shared rides (which have become a majority of my Lyft pings so now my acceptance rate is pure shit) but I take those rides when it\\u2019s painfully slow and I get reminded why I don\\u2019t accept them. Between the weed smells, the Ebonics, the \\u201cyou have to do what I tell you\\u201d attitude, fiddling with my radio, fiddling my ac, rolling the windows down on 115 degree days, the list goes on and on. When I see a shared ping come in and I\\u2019m not desperate it\\u2019s immediately denied. Sorry Shanequa with the 3.4 rating, not today. And why do they always have to make or take phone calls or FaceTime calls and have them on speaker full fucking volume? Or watching Snapchat videos the same way? That aggravates me to no end\\n\\nI understand I may get banned for this, but I tried to list grievances for all people and not just one.

I'm thinking that I'm going to get paid for wait-time and she has offered me a free soda and a meal (I took her up on the soda).  Once I put all the food in my car, which included six smoothies, 2 apple crisp w/ ice cream, 2 banana splits, three steak meals, 9 soft drinks/milks, and some other appetizers, I swiped the app for the delivery address.  It said I was to deliver to the hotel right next door (500 feet away).  I began thinking something was up, and this was confirmed when the hotel receptionist said that the names on the order didn't match the guest list, and that there were no large parties that night.  I called the customer and a female answered.  She told me that her husband was running some errands and that he would meet me at the gas station next door in five minutes.  I went there and waited 10 minutes.  I called the number again.  This time a man answered and told me that his wife works at the Denny's and that she would be off in five minutes, and that I should meet her there.  So I went there and told the Denny's manager what was happening.  I also found from the Uber website that I was to discard the items if I wait longer than 10 minutes, so I told the manager that.  She said to go ahead and discard the items.  So I drove home and discarded them in my refrigerator.  I stopped at a green light hub to remove myself from UberEats.

Prepare yourselves.\", \"text\": \"For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, Winter is right around the corner, and in some places may even be rearing it's cold head.\\n\\nSo I would like to take this moment to remind other drivers of some things you may want to take a look at it before the heart of winter arrives.\\n\\n1 - Check your Tires!  \\n\\\\- - Ensure your tires are holding pressure. If you're having to add air to a tire, you may have a slow leak. Take it to a Tire Shop and see if the can find the leak, and if possible repair/patch it.  \\n\\\\- - Check your Tread Depth! The minimum Tread Depth you should have is 2/32nd's. The easiest check is to grab a penny, turn Lincoln on his head and stick it in the tread of your tire. If part of Lincoln's head is covered, your tread is deep enough. If the tread does not cover Lincoln's head, it is too shallow. That's the minimum height. Recommended depth is 6/32nd's for Snow and 4/32nd's for Rain/Water.  \\n\\\\- - - - This may require replacement of your tires. But think about how much you are driving. You need those tires to get you around. There's still a couple months before the middle of winter is upon us. Start saving, if you can. I know you want to making those deliveries, but let's be as safe as we can!  \\n\\\\- - Some places receive lots of Snow! You know the Winter Weather for your area. If you're new to an area, you may want to learn about Chains and How To Use Chains On Your Car. Chaining up, especially in mountainous regions, is almost always a requirement, especially for Semi-Truck Drivers. The last thing I'd want to hear about is someone losing a Redditor because they lost control of their vehicle on an icy road.\\n\\n2 - Check your Brakes!  \\n\\\\- - It's a simple check by a mechanic. Have them check to ensure your brakes are in proper working condition. Remember that in wet weather it will take a longer distance for your vehicle to come to a complete stop. Especially if the roads are iced over.\\n\\n3 - Check your Radiator Fluid!  \\n\\\\- - In the Summer Months using water or a high mixture of water over Antifreeze may be okay. But Winter can and will freeze water in your radiator, tubes, and inside your engine block. Ice expands as it freezes and can/will eventually cause damage to your vehicles engine and coolant system. My recommendation is to take your vehicle in to a nearby shop and have them check it and verify that you have a good mixture of Anti-Freeze and water  \\n.- - If possible, do a \\\"Flush\\\" of your system, especially if you have never done it before. Newer vehicles may not need a Flush. But definitely, if you've an older vehicle and never done a Flush. Talk with a local mechanic, they may recommend you get one done.\\n\\n>\\\\*3a - u/Saint_Dogbert \\\\- RecommendsDepending on where you go, if your vehicle has no service history expect that shop to recommend a bunch of stuff that may NOT be needed.  \\n>  \\n>Fine the owners manual for your vehicle, cross reference the current odometer mileage to the recommended service interval in that book. A lot of \\\"older\\\" (in mileage) cars have \\\"milestone\\\" points were major items are expected to at least be serviced if not replaced. If you don't recall replacing/service something in the last year and your in-between mileage service intervals, I would suggest doing it now, before winter hits hard. That may include a radiator flush, oil/lubing key components or replacing things like fuel filters, ect.  \\n>  \\n>Also if you insist on using the \\\"quick lube\\\" places for some of these things. Make sure you watch them like a hawk. They will try to get you to \\\"relax\\\" in your car of their waiting area, where you cant see if the shop is being shady and charging for services not done.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n4 - Night comes early!  \\n\\\\- - We all understand that the Sun is setting earlier and earlier now. That means you will be turning on your headlights sooner. Do a quick check; make sure that BOTH headlights come on. While you are at it; Check the rest of your lights as well. Blinkers, Tail lights, Reverse Lights, Brake Lights, & Fog Lights (if you have them).  \\n\\\\- - Speaking of Lights: Get yourself a good Flashlight! It really helps when you have an amazingly powerful flashlight to help you find those pesky house numbers in the dark. Especially the ones hidden just outside a porch lights range. I personally use a little tactical flashlight (XT808) from Primitive Survivors. I was able to use a promo-code that got me 2 of these super bright flashlights for free (just paid shipping and handling). I'm telling you... at 800+ Lumens... it is absolutely blindingly bright. I don't know if the Promo is still available, but DEFINITELY do recommend that you do your research and see if you can get your hands on a very good flashlight. And it never hurts to have a good working flashlight for your home in case the power goes out.\\n\\n5 - Dress Warm!  \\n\\\\- - Yes, you're going to be nice and warm inside your vehicle. But you're going to need to step out of it to pick up food & deliver food. Stay as warm as you can. Make certain you have clothing and shoes appropriate for your area. I know I need new shoes and possibly warmer pants.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThese are just my RECOMMENDATIONS as to what you should do to prepare for Winter. Obviously you do what is best for you. Just remember that your vehicle is your life as a delivery driver and in some cases can mean the difference between being on the road, or on the side of the road. Maintenance now can help prevent Repairs later.\\n\\nStay safe out there.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Any other good advice I'll add to the Main Post, quoting the Redditor.\", \"polarity\": 0.16510439763488544, \"subjectivity\": 0.5254104195262732}, {\"title\": \"Absolutely not Lyft!

It was right at the intersection and I could see that the drive-thru wasn't busy, so I agree (plus this was my last ride before waiting for the late night surge). \\n\\nKate slurs her order, pays for the food, and we are off. At this point, most passengers won't eat in my car or will ask if it is okay. Not Kate. We don't even get out of the drive-thru and around the building before she is devouring one of the four crunchy tacos she ordered. I could just tell it was a mess purely based off all the noises she was making. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed she was eating it over the bag since it was on her lap. \\n\\nAfter her taco, she starts coughing. Not like a little I've-got-a-tickle-in-my-throat cough. Like a full on hacking-up-a-lung-because-I-smoke-10-packs-a-day cough. While she does this the remainder of the trip, she doesn't once cover her mouth. Lara even told her to cover her \\\"disgusting mouth\\\" a few times. Finally, I drop them off and the coughing equivalent of nails on a chalkboard is out of my life. \\n\\nKate opens the door and the light comes on. There is a handful of shredded cheese and lettuce all down the front of her shirt. When she stands up, there was about the same amount on the seat. I drive around the corner of the block to get out and angrily brush the food off my seat. Curiosity strikes, so I look to see how much I was paid. I pull up my last trip and it shows just under $3.50. That just isn't going to cut it. \\n\\nI go on to submit a photo of the cheese and lettuce on my seat to support. Within the hour, I received a $40 cleaning fee. I have had people leave a piece or two of shredded lettuce behind, but I ultimately gave the green light for them to eat. But Kate's attitude, lack of respect for my property, and lack of manners pushed me over the edge. I feel a little guilty for making Lara cover the cost of her friend's rudeness, but you are the company you keep. \\n\\nThe lesson to be learned here, is to respect other people's property and to submit it to support even if it isn't a substantial issue/mess. Some will tell me the real lesson is to not stop at Taco Bell and that is probably true. However, out of the few times I have stopped, she has been my only issue pax and ultimately paid $40 for a 10 second \\\"cleaning\\\" job.\\n\\nTL;DR: A rude pax left a handful of cheese and lettuce on my seat for a $40 cleaning fee on $3.50 ride. \", \"polarity\": -0.0265873015873016, \"subjectivity\": 0.4909410430839002}, {\"title\": \"First pax kicked out after 6900 rides...\", \"text\": \"Well, after 6900 rides, I kicked out my first passanger. \\nLady ordered ride for family member, pax #1 and pax #2 get on the way to the casino.

So that shifts out the labor-supply curve and just that shift alone, of course, decreases wages. But then you have tips added on to that, that make wages roughly the same as what they were before.\", \"polarity\": 0.13344988344988346, \"subjectivity\": 0.4735722610722611}, {\"title\": \"Gotta love weekly feedback sometimes...\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.5, \"subjectivity\": 0.6}, {\"title\": \"Crossposting here because of the strike talk\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"title\": \"They can keep the tip on this one.\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"title\": \"Got tipped 10.00 cash after I told the customer how DOORDASH takes the first 4.50 of our tips.\", \"text\": \"Customer: I tipped you 20% on the App. \\n\\nMe: Thanks so much.

They rarely require help and they\\u2019re nice. The caveat is most are pretty rich and have an assistant with them so I don\\u2019t have to do much. Some have real service dogs which shed like hell but surprisingly I\\u2019m not even mad at the fact that I\\u2019m forced to stopped driving for an hour to look for a working vacuum to clean it up. These people are generally my sweet spot and reaffirm that I am human and have a heart. \\n\\n\\nButtttttttt then I\\u2019m brought back into reality. This doesn\\u2019t happen a lot. Pretty rare to be honest but I just had two riders back to back who were disabled with the wheely things to help them walk. One was with National MedTran which immediately ticked me off and made me want to cancel on the spot but Lyft is bitching about me cancelling and not accepting rides so probably not best to rock the boat over this which could look bad. This woman to my joy was old and surprisingly great. She got in the car with her wheely thing by herself. I\\u2019ve had moments where I had to help people with their wheely and wheelchairs and trying to get it to fit in the car is a waste of time and pain in the ass because they should be ordering XL if we\\u2019re being honest. Anyway, she was great and easy.\\n\\nOn the way back to the city I have both apps running and I get a hit with Lyft again, I pull up and it\\u2019s another old person with a wheely. I\\u2019m starting to get irritated, but maybe she requires no help like the last rider. Nope, she does and I\\u2019m not that thrilled if we\\u2019re being honest with each other. He wheely wouldn\\u2019t fit in the trunk and it took a while to get it to fit in the car. She was annoying and a back seat driver telling me turn when I had a gps. The ride was only 5 minutes but guess who only made $3.75 while Lyft made $5.37? \\n\\n\\nLet\\u2019s get one thing clear\\nI\\u2019m not mad or irritated at having to pick up disabled people. What pisses me off is Lyft partnering with a medical transport company, EXPECTING ME TO HELP RIDERS FOR FUCKING FREE!!!! Lyft and Uber have told me in writing I\\u2019m not expected nor required to do anything beyond provide a seat and a safe ride to passengers. I don\\u2019t have to help them with luggage, Uber outright said I don\\u2019t even have to make a u turn if they can cross the street. Both company\\u2019s feed riders with crap to save face but my take is this. By having more disabled people on the platform your putting me in a position to do all this work to accommodate them for free. I have no way to filter them out. I should be paid more at the very least. \\n\\n\\nRecommendations.\\n-Medical companies should be charged more. Maybe $5-10 extra directly to drivers for the inconvenience.\\n\\n-Driver should be allowed to filter disabled people\\u2019s request. This isn\\u2019t discrimination well it is but. The way I see it is, Lyft is pressuring drivers to go beyond the contractor role. If a disabled person can not enter the car without assistance from the driver and the driver isn\\u2019t legally compelled by Lyft to assist the rider, that theoretically would be a dispute between worker and company before it would be worker discriminating against disabled person. Symantec\\u2019s and chain of events. \\n\\n-Lyft and Uber should pay drivers the total amount paid by rider/medical company excluding taxes. This means the driver gets the service and platform/safety fees.\\n\\n\\nI understand Lyft and Uber getting heat from ADA but they need to realize drivers are not medical transporters and don\\u2019t want these rides, at least not for free while being required to put in more work.\", \"polarity\": 0.12487638888888893, \"subjectivity\": 0.4575999999999999}, {\"title\": \"Guess this means customers who ask for different delivery locations are gonna be shit outta luck.

It had been an unusually good night, lots of deliveries, some multiples, and some long distance ones with tips, so I called it quits around 1am. I parked my car in tow zone, cuz its 1am, and who cares, I'll only be a minute. I ran into a liquor mart to grab some beer and chips, which would go lovely with the rotisserie chicken I had at home. \\n\\nI was browsing the beer selection in the back, oblivious, wondering to myself what delicious beer would go with the chicken I had at home, when I heard a police officer, over a megaphone, telling someone at the liquor store entrance to kneel and put their hands on their head.  \\n\\nI looked over the stack of wine bottles separating me from the front door, and saw a police spotlight, and heard the megaphone, again, ordering two guys to put their hands on their heads and not reach in their waistbands. I couldn't see the suspects, but I knew there had been a couple of guys behind me, I had heard them joking around and talking just moments before. I froze in my aisle with my Arrogant Bastard and Kettle chips. I put them down. \\n\\nI listened while the officers ordered the two guys around. They asked over the megaphone if anyone else was in the store. I knew it was me, and the cashier. I slowly moved to the end of the aisle, where the open front door was, and waved my arms. Nobody responded. I stupidly assumed they had their guys and didn't care about who else was in the store. I moved to the front area of of the store, about where the cashier would enter his glass encased booth. It curved around beyond the front door, so I was essentially unseen from the front door where the cops were. \\n\\nThe cashier finally showed up, and asked me what was going on. I told him what had happened since he had left. I had no idea what to do, and neither did he. We were both out of view of the officers. After a couple minutes, I figured they had their guys, and I just wanted to grab my chips and beer, pay, and leave. As I crossed to get my snacks, I saw an LAPD officer at the front door, a huge ass gun strapped across his chest. He yelled at me \\\"COME OUT!\\\" Oh fuck. \\n\\nI walked out with my hands up, mostly worried about my car that's parked in a tow zone. This was only supposed to take a minute. They tell me to stand to the left, with my hands behind my back, and feet apart. The cashier, who spoke good English, but not great, is totally bewildered, and is also ordered outside and told to stand next to me. We are both ordered to hold our hands behind our backs. Then we are both frisked, and not cuffed, but two officers holds our hands behind our backs while we are still facing the wall of the liquor mart. \\n\\nThere were seven LAPD cars, not sedans, but SUV's, lights on, blocking Sunset and La Brea, a major thoroughfare. A few people on Sunset are filming me and the cashier, with our faces to the wall. It was kind of devastating, I didn't want to end up on the internet, seeing as how I was just in the wrong place at the the wrong time. After about 6-8 minutes, another officer came up an asked us if we knew why we were being detained. He said that two guys matching the description of the other two guys in the store had committed a robbery, and someone had called in saying they had run into this liquor store, and since we had been inside, it was protocol to detain us until they knew enough to let us go.\\n\\nI had to give all my info, and then was let go. I saw the two guys they had cuffed were also let go, those two were not the robbers they were looking for. The cashier and I went back inside, and I finished buying my chips and beer. \\n\\nTL;DR: LAPD detained me for being in a liquor store with two innocent guys they said matched the description of a couple of robbers. \", \"polarity\": -0.04765211640211642, \"subjectivity\": 0.5626322751322751}, {\"title\": \"Lolwut?

They're sculpting the payouts of their deliveries not based on a consistent system like they claim - time, milage, desirability - but by paying whatever they think the minimum they can get away to get someone to take the order.

It was done unilaterally without discussion.\\n\\nSince that day I have been in constant contact with Uber Help in order to get this situation resolved satisfactorily for all parties. To date I have not received a reasonable explanation as to why my referral bonus was not paid. The form-letter response has been: \\u201cAfter carefully reviewing your account, we have concluded that this referral was associated with improper use of the Uber application, which violates the terms of the promotion. As a result, it will be removed from your payment statement.\\u201d\\n\\nI have asked repeatedly for a *specific* example of our \\u201cimproper use.\\u201d No reason has been given.

(Wall of words)\", \"text\": \"I started with OrderUp in the Spring of 2015, and was absorbed into Grubhub in October of 2017, I believe.  OrderUp was a dream. Grubhub is not. I feel as though I have a very strong knowledge of both delivery processes and the market my city occupies (Nashville, if it helps). We are not a *super* busy market, and though I work full-time (50+ hours, actually), I generally end up relying on the minimum pay as orders are rarely of sufficient volume to break it. I would like to share my opinions and experiences, starting with today (which fed me up).\\n\\nThis morning I woke up to start my 8-12 shift and signed on. Similar to a post I saw lower in the subreddit, I was not receiving orders and soon realized I was indeed *not* signed on, and my entire block was dropped. Fine. Needing money, I took a 11-2 shift before my 3-7. First order is Subway, but they're closed once I arrived (even though it had been confirmed?). Fine, call it in and they cancel it. I check my pay summary and have a missed order. I shouldn't, as after my shift was dropped, I kept a strict eye on my app. Called Driver Support again, and apparently I had missed the order somehow once before I actually managed to accept it. Despite the fact the restaurant was closed, and I DID in fact accept it (albeit - apparently - the second time around), there is nothing but one missed order on my pay summary. I was even assigned a second order (which was confirmed halfway there) only to arrive to a closed restaurant. Only one missed order, zero accepted orders. I have made no money today.\\n\\nI'm feeling pretty unappreciated and emailed Driver Pay nearly demanding they pay me $33 for the three hour shift - no way I'm going to work my 3-7 on the Fourth of July with such a precarious start to the day. As I'm feeling so beaten up by Grubhub, I thought I would share my collected list of gripes I have against the company as a driver. I would love to hear some of your experiences, and if you agree or disagree with any of my notes. Beware: boring list ahead.\\n\\n**Shifts are not easily stacked with half hour increments \\u201coverlapping\\u201d any convenient options**\\n\\nFull order details are not shared with us \\u2013 Why won\\u2019t you tell us what the drink is? Or what side they ordered?\\n\\n**Grubhub confirms orders without the restaurant\\u2019s confirmation \\u2013 this happened twice to me today (the 4th of July) and I learned it\\u2019s called something to the effect of \\u201cNon-confirmation override\\u201d**\\n\\nRegion boundaries are not clear; I deliver outside the boundaries often but get conflicting answers on whether this is proper or not. Receiving texts saying \\u201cRETURN TO THE ZONE\\u201d indicates to me something is wrong, yet is not remedied.\\n\\n**App updates don\\u2019t provide information about what they changed, every update simply says \\u201cWe have taken your suggestions into consideration\\u201d or something to that effect. In addition, it seems as if some feature is consistently knocked off with each update. Customer last names disappeared (understandable but unhelpful, and also not announced, it simply happened), ability to reject orders in-app, etc. have been recent lost features.**\\n\\nI\\u2019m swung from corner to corner of our delivery zone. A 15, or even 10, minute drive from a dropoff to the next restaurant is absurd and not included in the gas fees they pay us. Drives between orders are often where most of my gas goes anyway.\\n\\n**Driver Support is far too difficult to reach**\\n\\nWe can\\u2019t reject orders without calling Driver Care anymore?\\n\\n**The app and system itself is glitch-ridden**\\n\\nDriver Support says they cannot undo \\u2018Missed\\u2019 or \\u2018Rejected\\u2019 orders, even if they are in error. Despite being in an open location, a few days ago I couldn\\u2019t acquire connection, leading me to be unable to accept an order. I contacted support who assured me it must have been my phone, and that the missed order will remain to not only cut into my acceptance score for the day, but my driver rating for acquiring new shifts.\\n\\n**Why is texting the customer (or better yet, Driver Support) not a primary option? Calling is not always convenient.**\\n\\nThe dispatch is inconsistent. They send me additional orders before I have completed my first. This is bad for two reasons:\\n\\n\\\\- I\\u2019m often nearing a customer while driving but need my GPS/delivery info. To attempt to accept an order while moving is both unsafe and unhelpful to the order at hand. Similarly, and arguably more frustrating, is calling a customer (usually upon their request) only to hear the horrid cowbell and have to juggle your phone through several apps, while a customer is on the line.\\n\\n\\\\- If you assign additional orders to drivers prematurely/predelivery, you are assuming preemptively that that driver will be the closest to the following restaurant. However, even five minutes can make a difference of the location of drivers around the city. Assigning me an order, before I\\u2019ve delivered another, to across town makes no sense when if dispatch waited even mere moments, a more convenient driver could become available.\\n\\n\\\\- *I don\\u2019t know if dispatch is entirely automated or has a human touch, but it often seems (or at least feels) quite deliberate.*\\n\\n**I believe Grubhub wants to keep its costs as low as possible \\u2013 fair enough, right? However, I believe it is at the expense of drivers:**\\n\\n**- The recent lawsuit about ghosted orders feels very familiar. I hadn't received one in some months until today with my missed Subway order, but when I began in October (after years of OrderUp, who was absorbed by GH) it was a common occurrence.**\\n\\n**- My market, Nashville, is slow. I understand it is not one of the raging markets. However, I rarely make more than floor pay, working at least 6 hours every day, if not 8 on weekdays. It would be fair for them to spread orders out to all drivers who have taken shifts (before non-shifted drivers) but I\\u2019m confident they strategically dispatch orders in accordance to the amount of \\u201cGrubhub Contribution\\u201d you have received thus far in the day.**\\n\\n\\\\- **Say I\\u2019ve worked two hours and am ahead of \\u201cfloor pay\\u201d by $2, meaning in my market, I\\u2019ve made $24. I am under the impression they will freeze me from getting orders until ALL drivers have, or are as close to, $0 Grubhub Contribution as possible. This**** sou****nds fair - we all need orders! However, if none of us are making more than floor, and Grubhub is distributing orders evenly to keep from paying their own money in contributions, there is a key aspect of dispatch missi****n**g.\\n\\n\\\\- **Dispatch should be based on nothing more than proximity to the restaurant and, perhaps, how much time you have left in your shift. How much money you have made should frankly be irrelevant, especially if you are signed up to blocks/shifts. That is what the minimum payment is for. Those closest to restaurants should, both technically and, in my opinion, sensibly receive the orders closest to them and without consideration of pay. Don\\u2019t send me from East Nashville to West simply because I haven\\u2019t made enough to cover GH\\u2019s minimum payment.**\\n\\nI have never had a responsive contact with whom to communicate issues within Grubhub (my driver specialist is not helpful; I am trying to acquire his job, hahaha)\\n\\n**Simply because I came from OrderUp, the whole \\u201c$11 an hour plus keep your tips!\\u201d seems as close to deceptive marketing as you can get. OrderUp truly paid us hourly. Each hour was its own measurement, meaning if we made more than $11 in one hour (actually $12 at the time), it stayed intact and was not applied to your earnings for the whole day, whereas with Grubhub, you can make $44 your first shifted hour, then have no orders for your remaining three, and still only make $44. OrderUp would have paid us the $44, then an additional $11 (or 12) for each hour afterward, making the total $77.**\\n\\n**- I understand this is possibly why OrderUp was absorbed by Grubhub \\u2013 they couldn\\u2019t maintain such a payscale. However, I hope it\\u2019s understandable that the way they phrase their pay is not equivalent to other delivery services. I would generally make at least an extra $100-200 a week with OrderUp. Based on a point above, though, I\\u2019m not surprised Grubhub tries to pay as little \\u201cContribution\\u201d as possible, and setting the hourly pay up as OrderUp did would cost them more (though we deserve it).**\\n\\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading and letting me air my grievances. I have reached out to a variety of employees at Grubhub wishing to converse with them about particular items on this list but have never made contact with an employee who is willing to dive deep with me on the issues. I love being a delivery driver, and want Grubhub to be the best it can be.

Thought y'all might enjoy this mornings adventure...\\n\\nI walk the kiddo to school, walk to the gym, workout, shop at the grocery store next to the gym, and as I'm paying for my food I summon an Uber to head home.  A driver - we'll call him Peter, because that's his name - accepts, and is 2 minutes away; AWESOME!  I head outside to where I dropped the \\\"pick-up pin\\\" and start looking for his car/license plate.  For context, this is in a little commercial center with ~14 businesses, the largest of which is the grocery store (QFC) I'm standing in front of, and they all share a giant parking lot with 3 entrances - two on the west border, one on the north border.  Peter is coming from the south, and misses the two turn ins on his right, so he turns at the light to take the northern entrance.  I am following his progress on the app, and see him turn in.... and then watch him drive over to the Starbucks about 100 yards from the grocery store.  I watch him get out and walk into the Starbucks, so I start to walk over there, schlepping all my grocery bags (all these groceries being the main reason I chose to Uber today instead of walk/bus home).  I get outside the Starbucks and he texts me through the app \\\"At the Starbucks\\\"... Ooooookay.  I'm waiting, and waiting, and he comes over to the window I'm outside of and taps on it - holds up a hand and mimes \\\"Just a sec\\\".... oooookay.  \\n\\nAt this point, it's been 10 minutes since I summoned an Uber that was 1 minute away.  I would be home by now if he just, you know... picked me up, like he's supposed to do.  He finally comes out a back door and walks over to his car, yelling (yeah, yelling) a perfunctory \\\"Sorry about that!\\\", like it was some sort of unavoidable delay completely outside of his control.\\n\\nI schlepp my bags over and get in the backseat, and ask him if this is some sort of hidden camera show.  He laughs, and then immediately starts making excuses: \\n\\n* First, by telling me \\\"he drove past and nobody was here!\\\", pointing to the sidewalk he's parked in front of - well, no shit man, that's not where I was, or where the pick-up pin is, so fucking SHOCKER that nobody is on that exact patch of sidewalk, ~ 100 yards from the storefront.  I explain that that's not where the pickup pin was, and that there are multiple other businesses than just the Starbucks he wants to patronize.\\n\\n* Second tactic of his is to try mockery, by saying \\\"Oh sorry you had to wait 2 minutes bro!\\\" in a shitty, angry tone of voice.\\n\\n* At this point, we still haven't left; apparently all the blood rushing to his angry face is preventing him from safely driving, and I tell him he's the most unprofessional Uber driver I've had in 5+ years of regular usage.  His response, \\\"Then get the FUCK outta my car!!!\\\", and doing the charge-me-$5-cancel, instead of the \\\"normal\\\" driver-cancel.\\n\\n* After that, I told him in no uncertain terms how unprofessional he was, to which he replied \\\"Whatever, I'm 5 stars and climbing, bro\\\", which actually got a laugh out of me; he's not only rude and incompetent, but he's actually too stupid to understand how the rating system works.  I (very) briefly explained how stupid that is, and wished him luck in this fantasy world of his he's created in his own head.\\n\\nQuick shoutout to all the awesome Uber drivers I've had over the years - most of y'all are awesome.

It was a New Years surge so my brain was like cha-ching, but I said \\u201cyes of course.\\u201d\\n\\nHe then a asked me how much gas I had and I said about half a tank. He offered to fill up my tank while he went inside the station to buy some things. Not sure if we\\u2019re allowed to accept but I obviously did. Anyway, he pretty much passed out for the entire ride there. I woke him up once we arrived. He called his girl and started arguing with her over the phone, repeating things like \\u201csee what happens\\u201d, \\u201cdead ass\\u201d and \\u201cbet\\u201d multiple times. She hung up on him at least 20 times and he kept calling her back. It was obviously uncomfortable but I was about to drop him off anyway.\\n\\nWe arrive and he asks if I don\\u2019t mind waiting because he needs me to drive him back. As much as I wanted to get rid of him because he\\u2019s clearly a weirdo, I was still being paid surge prices and would driving back on his dime, rather than 2 hours of dead miles. I also considered the fact that I may be a wheelman for a crime this guy was about to commit. But again surge prices. So he paces back and forth trying to call her again and waiting for her to get home from the bars, meanwhile I\\u2019m in my car scrolling through instagram. I\\u2019m pretty tired at this point since it\\u2019s 4am and I\\u2019ve been working since 2pm the day before. \\n\\nI get out to stretch and figured I\\u2019d make small talk. He says he met his girlfriend a few months back and said he feels like she\\u2019s the one. But she recently moved to the city to follow her dreams and do the whole New York thing. I guess she started going out more and more, and he heard from her less and less (Hotline bling anyone?)  He thought she was being disrespectful so he figured by showing up to her place at 4am to talk would decide the future of they\\u2019re relationship, even if it cost him an expensive Uber ride. I said I understood and that we\\u2019ve all done some pretty outlandish shit for women.\\n\\nSo she finally gets back and he goes upstairs to talk to her, and I go back to staring at my phone and hearing the early morning crazies scream at each other. He comes down an hour later in seemingly a good mood. He says he really appreciates me waiting and we head back. I didn\\u2019t really ask questions because I was too tired to have a deep conversation with a stranger and 5am. But he basically indicated that things went well and he passed out again for the ride back. I got home around 9am and passed the fuck out. Uber had to review the fare for about 2 days before I was paid. Between my casino job and Uber I made about $1500 in 18 hours. Most profitable day of my life.\\n\\n\", \"polarity\": 0.0037961583043550234, \"subjectivity\": 0.37611773472429205}, {\"title\": \"Lady cut me off at the mall yesterday\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"title\": \"Anyone else have this bs?\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"title\": \"Entitled PAX\", \"text\": \"Another discussion post for the sub.

He tells me, right here is good, but I am confused because we are in front of a Papa Johns Pizza. He thanks me for the ride, puts on a Papa Johns hat and walks into Papa Johns. \\n\\nWtf!  I wasn\\u2019t even thinking about tacos until he brought it up, but I spent the last ten minutes anticipating not just tacos, but free/tip tacos. Why would someone do this?  It messed with my head all night, so on my way home, I had to stop at a Roberto\\u2019s. \\n\", \"polarity\": 0.016280284043441944, \"subjectivity\": 0.4262949039264829}, {\"title\": \"PSA: Do not order a waffle cone sundae for delivery\", \"text\": \"Your driver has no way to carry it and your order is going to get cancelled multiple times and you will never receive it.

It was an UberXL request and I was excited about making some good money and about where the trip might take me. \\n\\nGot some warning vibes from this group right away. As I pulled up to the address they punched in, they called me and said \\\"You need to turn around, you're past us. Flip around and come back.\\\" Already I could tell that at least the person on the phone hadn't been freshly taught about manners or politeness. \\n\\n\\\"Whatever, not a big deal, it's a good trip.\\\" I told myself. As this group of males and females in their mid twenties load in, they don't acknowledge my existence. I try to instruct them on how to efficiently access the 3rd row, no attention paid, they climb over the seats. Once everyone is loaded in, they start barking orders at me. \\\"Don't pay attention to your phone, we're going somewhere else first.\\\" okay... \\\"Turn left at the next stop\\\" Then, as I approach the next stop preparing to make the left, one second row girl, one third row girl again command \\\"Turn left here\\\". No pleases, no thank yous, no acknowledgement that you're dealing with a reasonably intelligent human being here, only commands to a dumb servant. We pull up to pick up another friend who takes his time finishing his beer from his balcony. (Normally, any two or so of these signs of disrespect to me or my time might have ended the ride but I kept reminding myself this was a good paying trip and knew it would be a lot of drama if I cancelled the ride. You gotta choose which hill you want to die on.) Not wanting to start this long trip off on a bad vibe of me scolding them to use the word *please*, I let all of it slide and just hoped to hurry and get to the meat of the trip where I could just focus on driving and let them do their thing. \\n\\nThe girl in the front seat was very nice. She seemed out of place with this group. She asked me about my day and complimented my car. All totally unnecessary \\\"nice talk\\\" but I appreciated that she was making an effort to be nice and to be the intermediary for the group (there's usually one in every group huh?). We made small talk and she joked with me that this might be a tough ride. She made promises of good tips to compensate for what I was in for and tipped me five bucks five minutes into the ride with promises of more. Again, appreciated, not necessary. Just want a little bit of civility and we can all enjoy the trip. As her friends became more crass and started doing things like trying to convince me to let them crack open beers in the car, \\\"...don't worry about it, I'll tell the cop I forced you\\\", the girl in the front seat started getting more and more anxious. She literally put her forehead in her hand for a good duration of the trip and said she was having a small anxiety attack, which her friends laughed off. \\n\\n20 and 30 minutes into the trip, the two dudes in the 2nd row seat occasionally get up on their knees and lean over into the third row. I was wondering what the hell they were up to but just let it go. Then on the third or fourth lean-over, I hear snorting. In the rearview I clearly see them snorting lines in my car. This was it. I was finished with this ride and ready for it to be over. I say curtly \\\"Can you sit down please??\\\" He sits down. He then tells his friends he's doing everything he can to hold back right now (from what I don't know) and to make sure and rate me zero stars. I say \\\"well why don't we go ahead and end this ride now then?\\\" I pull over and let them out. The B in the very back, the one who was rudest the whole time gets out... \\\"are you fucking serious you fucking asshole? what the fuck?\\\" on and on and on calling me every name in the book. With everyone piled out, the sweet girl from the front seat is literally in tears, her worst fears for the trip now realized. I genuinely feel bad for her and remembering our short-lived, faux bond, and as a gesture of trying to inject some humanity and sanity into the terrible experience, I say \\\"Hey, sorry\\\" and hold up the 5 bucks, asking if she wants her tip back. She nods her head no but the B from the backseat says \\\"fuck yeah we want it back, give it to me! fuck you!\\\" and rips it out of my fingers.\\n\\nI pull a mile away and around the corner and send Uber a message detailing what happened. 15 minutes later I get a message from Uber telling me that a rider had reported I was \\\"impaired\\\" during a trip and that they were suspending my account. \\n\\nShocked yet half expecting it at the same time, I immediately respond, telling Uber that this was a revenge report from the passengers I had just booted from my vehicle for doing drugs. I assured them that I was absolutely not on anything and they could see I had been giving trips the last few hours and therefore it would have been impossible for me to become \\\"impaired\\\". I also tell them I was willing to take a video conference call right away so they could judge for themselves if I seemed impaired. With no response to the video conference offer, I email a very nice, professional selfie video explaining the situation, which also gives them a chance to see my face, eyes and general condition. They respond with a tone-deaf response giving me tips on how to clear odors from my car. They tell me that sometimes previous passengers can bring a drug or alcohol smell in to the car and the next passenger will often attribute it to the driver. More tips on deodorizing my car.\\n\\nI send another message reiterating that there was no smell. That this story was entirely fabricated by drug using, verbally abusive passengers (who Uber claims in public that it wants to protect me from) and now these passengers were going to \\\"double-victimize\\\" me by costing me earnings on a busy Labor Day weekend. I remind them they can check my hard brakes and accelerations to see if I was driving erratically, check my driving history for the day, check my year and a half old 4.9 rated account for any reports of anything like this, assuring them they would not find any.\\n\\nThey simply responded with *nice messages* about how they also wanted to get me back on the road as soon as possible but the \\\"investigation\\\" might take 48 hours (costing me the whole weekend). What fucking investigation? Were they going to remotely take samples of the odors in my car? It was my word vs the riders' word and I had video, text testimony/evidence and a spotless history on my side. I let it go at that point, screw it.\\n\\nThis job is a joke. No security whatsoever. Any report from any passenger who wants to ruin your day, kill your earnings, or get you fired as a driver only has to type a few words about you being under the influence and then they go on with their day. Fuck this company. I understand Uber has to take all allegations seriously, and I said that in my messaging with them. But in most jobs if you are going to be suspended as a precaution over an unproven allegation, they will move you to a different department while the investigation into the incident is under way or suspend you with pay, etc. But this being a fucking joke of a no-respect, slave job, you get nothing like that. \\n\\nThey finally reactivated my account tonight after I had to remind them it was more than 48 hours and asked how the \\\"investigation\\\" was going. I don't know what evidence their investigation finally led them to, to conclude that I was not on drugs. If I'm being realistic, they only do this two day timeout thing so that they can cover their asses in front of the media or the courts later if something happens. They can claim that they took it seriously. Even though if I really was a drug taking driver, a two day \\\"investigation\\\" time out isn't going to help anything. \\n\\nThis is no way to employ people. Again, I reiterate, Uber is a fucking joke of a job. I may get trolls saying \\\"well then why do you do it? you dont have to!\\\" and like many people who do Uber, I am in a career/schooling transition period and this helps to accommodate that. But I treat this with just as much professionalism, preparedness and personal integrity, etc. as I would a regular job. Yet drivers don't get anything like that from Uber in return. All they get are \\\"nice messages\\\". Uber is basically sending me the message that I should have just let it go. If I did let the coke-snorting go on in my car without complaint, I wouldn't have had my account suspended.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Kicked out passengers for doing coke in my car, passengers told Uber I was the one on drugs, got me suspended without evidence.

I'm a little uneasy hoping to make up for lost time bringing the phone back to her and going that far out of my way from the Strip and I got a line ride for Caesar's palace as I'm heading north on the strip, it auto queues a second passenger at Flamingo which was great to catch me up on my missed rides from the phone drop off. \\n\\nAt this point I'm thinking \\\"Do I pickup the Flamingo person thru the back or front?\\\" the light turns green and I decide on the front. But the entrance was blocked off by the cops!!! I thought CRAP!!!! Had to go all the way around at that point to Sands, aka, majorly out of the way. After the missed turn / blocked street it added 7 minutes to the pickup so it auto cancelled my 2 passengers! \\n\\nI was frantically trying to make up for the 2 bad luck incidents and managed to get just 1 ride short of my $130 peak PDB. I was bummed I didn't get a tip from the cell phone lady and I missed the PDB but had a pretty great night overall. \\n\\nDespite this bad luck I never compromise my customer service with passengers and will always go out of my way to bring back lost stuff. (The karma has always paid off, just 2 days prior I took 20 minutes to bring a guy's jacket found in my back seat back to him and he tipped me $45!) \\n\\nAnyways back to the story, I shoot a brief message to Lyft about the scenario and go to bed a little disappointed but woke up to Alejandro from Lyft responding to me saying they would take care of the missing peak ride! How cool is that? That's an extra $70 (since I qualified for the $60) thanks to Lyft's awesome support, AND the lady who I brought the phone back to tipped me $30 in the app the next morning when she woke up. An extra $100 total I wasn't counting on!  \\n\\nJust wanted to share that little story from last night and remind new drivers out there that it isn't as bad as many of the toxic people on this thread make it out to be. =D \\n\\n$243 night for around 9 hrs, not including the $130 bonus I managed to score thanks to lyft\\u2019s help! \", \"polarity\": 0.04662781662781664, \"subjectivity\": 0.4102836052836053}, {\"title\": \"Pax were generous with their cash last night here in Vegas.

Been doing rideshare Uber for 2 months now and I know it was something I had to get eventually but finally ordered one last week, with a fat 128gb SD card. I received and installed it just 2 days ago.\\n\\nSo this happened today. I drove to the pickup location near an event in Venice Beach. I'm waiting there for a bit and then 3 big dudes, late 20's early 30's, appear in my rearview mirror at my doors. I unlock the doors and they get in. Immediately I realize these guys are drunk. They're loud and rowdy. The moment the doors close the guy in the back right \\\"asks\\\" if he can vape in my car. Before I can respond he's already rolling down the window and hitting his vape. I have no problem with people vaping in my car as long as the window is rolled down, and that's what I was in the process of responding to him, but the fact that he went ahead and did it before I could give him permission was really rude.\\n\\nI shrug it off and say whatever, start the ride. see that it's 51 min away. Alright. I put the car on drive and as soon as I'm about to drive off the guy in the back left seat exclaims, \\\"hey turn that camera off I don't want to be recorded. turn that shit off!\\\" I say, \\\"Sorry, the camera stays on. It's for safety reasons.\\\" He says something along the lines of, \\\"nah man turn that shit off. I don't feel comfortable being recorded.\\\" he became aggravated at me not having complied with his command and even more so after I told him no again. His other friends start butting in, \\\"we'll give you a fat cash tip man. just turn that shit off. leave it off. put that shit on airplane mode and let's go.\\\" whatever the fuck that means??\\n\\nSo let's take it back a bit. At this point I'm remembering [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/clsqn2/tonight_a_passenger_called_me_out_on_my_dash_cam/) thread I read on this sub making good points on how if a passenger asks you to turn your dashcam off it's a huge red flag. How there aren't any good reasons why a PAX would want the camera off.\\n\\nSo idk if it was due to this thread or my own intuition, or both, but I had already made up my mind that I was going to cancel the trip. I told the dude, \\\"hey man since you're not comfortable with me having the dashcam on i'm gonna have to cancel this ride.\\\" He raises his voice at me and is considerably more agitated, says something along the lines of, \\\"this is America and i can choose to not be recorded, the fuck is your problem? don't you wanna make money? lets just go.\\\" i tell him, \\\"oh don't worry I'm making money.\\\" his friend remarks, \\\"we're gonna give you a negative rating\\\" and they spew out some other bullshit of which is a blur but at some point i just say, \\\"the doors are unlocked, please get out of my car.\\\" and eventually they do but not before giving me a few insults.\\n\\nI am so fucking glad this is the decision I went with. It would've been a 50min trip from hell, stuck with these 3 fucking rude, degenerate, drunk aggro turds. 50 minutes of their bullshit of which they definitely would've escalated it to something more severe. I had my pepper gel in hand cause I really was worried I'd get attacked at some point. The dude in the back left seat especially, who was the one that asked to turn the cam off, was getting pretty heated up. And I'm also really glad i had the dashcam. They really do help weed out the bad apples. If it wasn't for the cam I wouldn't have had enough reason to kick these POS out and would have been stuck with them.\\n\\nAnyways, so 2 things to learn from this guys, 1: If a PAX asks you to turn your cam off end the trip then and there. Nothing good can come of that. And 2: Follow your intuition.\\n\\nAnd I also want to add; Alcohol sucks. 8/10 PAX that have given me a hard time have been drunks. And society likes to claim alcohol isn't a hard drug. Man, alcohol isn't even great for what it is. Stick to better, less harmful drugs if you're going to get inebriated, folks.

Everything you know about the Uber \\\"brand\\\" will cease to exist. You won't see any more brand-new or near-new vehicles, driven by well-educated people with other full- or part-time jobs. You won't be offered any more water bottles, candies, or mints. You'll get into 2005- and 2006-model compacts that barely meet the minimum standards for driving on the Uber platform. You'll be opening your own door and lifting your own luggage. Your heated seat will be \\\"broken\\\" and the window lock will be engaged when you ask to roll the window down, or attempt to do it yourself. Oh, and no tip? 1 star for you, because the idiot who just drove you around has now started to realize that they are doing so at a loss, but are probably in too deep with an Uber-sponsored auto loan to have an alternative. Before long, the only drivers left will be the ones that everyone was ditching taxi companies to avoid, and they'll be trying to get back into the taxi companies themselves. [Welcome to the Uber of 2015](http://timothyblotz.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/muppets-toyota-3.jpg).\\n\\n**TL;DR.** *Get out while you can if you drive, and get out while you can if you ride.*\\n\\nSome background: I'm in a few closed groups on Facebook for Uber drivers, and they've been incredibly active for the last several days, and especially the last 24 hours. I originally posted the e-mail exchange below there for other drivers to see, but I'm fine with sharing it with anyone who's willing to read it. I just hope that anyone who is on the fence about what to do about this can peek behind the curtain and understand that this is NOT going to improve any conditions whatsoever for them.\\n\\nAt 7:56 PM yesterday, I received an email announcing that fares in Indianapolis would be getting lowered. They were also lowered on October 23, 2014 for the first time since I had begun driving on February 19, 2014. They were originally $1.90 + $1.25/mile + $0.25/minute. On October 23, they went to $1.25 + $1.10/mile + $0.27/minute. Somewhere along the way, they instituted a $2.25 minimum fare, which had previously been $0, and is nothing short of an insult when you consider the driver had to show up to the passenger and wait for them to get in the car in the first place. Today at 3 PM, they will go to $1.25 + $0.80/mile + $0.18/minute, and Indianapolis is somewhere in the middle of the pack based on what I've seen from drivers in other cities. I took a few minutes to investigate the new fares, get the pulse of some other drivers, and process what was going on, but without any real analysis - just a gut feeling that this was very, very bad. At 8:41 PM, I fired off the following from my iPhone:\\n\\n>> Congratulations! You've just guaranteed that all your best drivers will find something else to do. I'm not driving for any less than what I was already earning. You're ignoring that I have to put more miles on my car to complete more trips, so completing more trips at a lower cost per trip only hurts my bottom line, not yours. I'm not supporting this company any more until fares go back up.\\n\\nExpecting no response, I spent the rest of the night ignoring the episodes of \\\"Sleepy Hollow\\\" that were flying by on my DVR while I read articles, message boards, Facebook groups, and text messages from other drivers. I read a [well-written post on Nashville's rates](http://uberpeople.net/threads/analysis-of-nashville-uber-low-rates-and-guarantee-math-is-involved.10597/), which as we all know now was a market that helped lead the charge in this \\\"experiment\\\"^[citation ^needed] (Uber's word, not mine, but I can't find the link where I read it), so they had some time to mull it over before the rest of the country got involved. I also find it strangely ironic that Uber is [actively seeking a new Operations and Logistics Manager for Nashville](https://www.uber.com/jobs/26678). Anyway, after a few hours it was pretty clear to me that the collective pulse of the drivers who use social media had reached a boiling point. At 1:14 AM, I received the following boilerplate response from Uber support:\\n\\n>> Hi Paul,\\n\\n>>Thanks so much for reaching out.\\n\\n>>I appreciate your feedback regarding our rates and wanted to provide a little more insight into how we came up with them with careful analysis.\\n\\n>>With more low cost options, we want to ensure we have competitive prices and that all riders can get affordable and reliable rides. While we\\u2019re confident in our rates, we want to assure you that we closely and regularly monitor the impact of our rates on your earnings. As we've seen in the past with price changes, we expect that partners will complete more trips and earn more than usual.\\n\\n>>In addition, we will continue to offer great incentives while you\\u2019re on the Uber system. You can always earn more money by inviting your friends to drive with Uber.\\n\\n>>I am happy to pass along all feedback; positive, negative and constructive. Thanks again for writing in, and please let me know if I can help with anything else.\\n\\n>>Best,\\n\\n>>Lyn\\n\\n>>Uber Support\\n\\nBy now I was prepared to respond. I knew the likelihood of them reading my response was remote, but I had enough information gathered and hours behind me to know that I had made my mind up on how I felt about all this. I spent the next half-hour or so crafting the following response, and sent it at 2:00 AM. I have yet to receive a response, but I'm not expecting one. I would start taking bets on the type of response I get, but nobody has any money left to bet. For your entertainment, feel free to guess whether I get a) no response; b) a canned response; c) a personal email response; d) a phone call; or e) deactivated with no further questions.\\n\\n>>Lyn,\\n\\n>>Thanks for the copy-and-paste response. I feel ***so*** valued as an individual patron and a partner. If there\\u2019s an actual human reading this message, please continue. I do intend all of this constructively, but I\\u2019ll be very frank with you. I\\u2019m pissed, and I\\u2019m not going to sugarcoat anything or hold anything back. If there\\u2019s still a human reading this at the end of the message and wants to actually talk to me about it with a rational and grounded conversation based on facts and statistics instead of propaganda and Uber Kool-Aid, please feel free to call me. But I\\u2019m not going to read your copy-and-paste responses, and I\\u2019m not logging back in as a driver until this highway robbery is over.\\n\\n>>I\\u2019m not completing any more trips until rates go back up to what they were when I originally started driving for Uber. I\\u2019m not working for free, and at the rates you\\u2019ve just introduced, that\\u2019s pretty close to what it would be after expenses and taxes. If Uber truly cared about their \\u201cpartners\\u201d instead of just getting more riders, then they would have decreased the commission they take from every trip in like manner to dropping the rates. If partners were keeping 90% or 95% of the fares, then you might be able to convince some of us that you actually have our best interests in mind. Instead, you keep the same percentage commission for Uber, and continue to actively discourage tipping and disallow it from within the app despite it being the most commonly requested feature by my own passengers.\\n\\n>>I don\\u2019t want a patronizing response. I\\u2019m well-educated, so you can try to spin the numbers all you want, but I\\u2019m not dumb enough to fall for it. The IRS deduction rate of $0.575/mile for 2015 is pretty accurate in terms of the actual cost per mile to drive a vehicle after depreciation, gas, oil, maintenance, and other expenses. After Uber takes their 20% cut, the new rate in Indianapolis is earning drivers $0.64/mile, or a $0.065/mile margin over actual cost to operate. Even at 60 mph for the entire hour, a driver can\\u2019t net more than $12.54/hour, including the cost per minute (after 20% cut). That\\u2019s pretty much a best-case scenario without surge pricing, for someone who is on the move constantly.\\n\\n>>Any of your drivers who have a basic education should be able to figure this out. I feel sorry for anyone who accepts the new contract terms. They\\u2019re going to be losing money every time they agree to drive for you. I am so ashamed that I have spent most of the last year talking so positively about Uber and how great a job it was to have. It\\u2019s crystal clear to me now that you have absolutely no interest in creating sustainable jobs for people. You can pass on all the feedback you want, but as long as there are people dumb enough (or trapped enough) to keep driving for you, nobody in your office or the SF headquarters is going to care one bit what I have to say, and I\\u2019m fully aware of that.\\n\\n>>The fact that Uber is using Chicago\\u2019s year-over-year numbers as a basis for lowering fares (in 48 markets, at that, with most of them being vastly different from Chicago) is absolutely laughable to anyone with even a modicum of experience with statistics. This has been an unprecedented year of growth for Uber worldwide, with popularity growing exponentially, and you\\u2019re going to use data 12 months apart to attribute the increase in trips per hour to justify the fare decrease? You are absolutely out of your mind if you think that\\u2019s a reputable correlation to make. Even if lower fares were the only reason drivers were completing more trips per hour, let\\u2019s assume for simplicity\\u2019s sake that the average length and distance of each trip stayed the same. That would mean that drivers are SPENDING 45% more to move their vehicle around, but only bringing home 12% more revenue to support that increase in expenditures. Do you see the problem here yet?\\n\\n>>Even with the hourly guarantees that you\\u2019ve introduced, ever since Uber started taking 20% out of those too, it\\u2019s not been worth the promises made. $12/hour during off-peak hours? You\\u2019ve got to be kidding me. That\\u2019s $9.60/hour after Uber\\u2019s cut, and before expenses. The best-case scenario for someone working during those hours would be to complete one short ride each hour that begins almost exactly where they already are, and then sit with the car OFF for the rest of the hour hoping they get no more pings that will COST them money and cut into their bottom line. The \\u201cminimum guarantees\\u201d are no longer minima - they are effectively caps that people can only hope to maximize by completing as few trips as possible per hour. Every trip they complete adds cost to their bottom line and eats away at their margin of earning toward that guaranteed amount.\\n\\n>>As far as the referral incentive that you mentioned goes, Indianapolis is the only market I know of where drivers have to complete 100 trips to earn the referral bonus. Everywhere else I\\u2019ve inquired has a requirement of only 20 trips. So even though I\\u2019ve referred several people to Uber, none of them have reached 100 trips yet, despite their best efforts, and you better believe I\\u2019m going to do everything I can to convince them that it\\u2019s no longer worth it to even try to get there.\\n\\n>>I\\u2019m one of the lucky ones. I have other sources of income, so I don\\u2019t have to bend to your will. This was something that WAS a fun way for me to earn a little extra spending money, but now? I can\\u2019t in good conscience tell anyone anymore that I even like this company anymore. I used to get asked all the time by passengers, \\u201cDo you like Uber, or do you LOVE Uber?\\u201d and I would always answer that I loved it! I loved how social it was, how people were so friendly, and it was a reliable source of income. I would offer bottles of water to my passengers, turn on their heated seat, open their doors for them, lift their luggage. But with rates going this low, every single one of those things is now a net-negative income activity. You could even make an argument that turning on the climate control is no longer a benefit passengers deserve at these fares. The over-hyping and under-delivering of New Year\\u2019s Eve was the writing on the wall, and I was just discussing with my wife the other day that if Uber lowered their rates any more than where they already were, I couldn\\u2019t keep driving. Lucky for me, we had already made that decision before we were forced to, so it wasn\\u2019t a hard decision to make. I just can\\u2019t support a company that would do this to their partners. I am returning my phone to Uber tomorrow because I cannot justify the $10/week charge anymore and will not be accepting the terms on the driver app until partners are compensated fairly for their expenses and services rendered.\\n\\n>>More than anything, I\\u2019m just disappointed. I liked this company. But I feel betrayed.\\n\\n>>Paul\\n\\nI expect no changes to come on Uber's part for this. They've made their choice and there will be people who are willing to work for less, or even free, who don't realize that they are doing so. Uber's wordsmiths carefully crafted a message about \\\"increased earnings\\\" while neglecting to highlight the difference between earnings and profits. Not one driver's profits will increase as a result of this. So for the lucky few who have read and understand my message, get out while you can, and tell others why they should too.\\n\\n**EDIT 1** (1/10/2015, 7:17 AM): Woke up to [a response from Uber](http://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/2rvpld/why_im_through_with_uber_until_further_notice_and/cnkfl63) today. I'm going back to bed.\\n\\n**EDIT 2** (1/10/2015, 5:31 PM): Thank you /u/elcanon for the gold! That wasn't necessary but it is much appreciated. I am pretty certain that \\\"Lyn\\\" didn't actually read my message, based on their response, so I'm not planning on continuing the email chain. However, I'm very pleased that my message is getting out to those who these fare cuts affect most. We are not hourly employees. We are individual contractors. Don't accept their terms. Stop driving for Uber until they bring fares back up. My individual city is a very, very small and new market, so there usually aren't very many drivers available, but last night we had two poor souls trying out the new fares. Today, I have checked the app several times and there are no UberX drivers to be found, anywhere in the county. My hope is that they got the message and can now see the impact of the cuts after seeing the fares last night.

DoorDash guarantees it will contribute at least $1 per order, but beyond that, tip money can be used toward the total guaranteed amount. However, in 15 percent of cases, customers don\\u2019t tip, and DoorDash pays the full guaranteed minimum amount, according to numbers shared in the same article.\\n\\n>The company maintains that, overall, its workers are happier with its current pay system, and one DoorDash worker, Josh Roberts, wrote a Medium post in favor of the current pay policies. DoorDash says internal data shows that 80 percent of workers actually prefer it to an older pay model, phased out in 2017, that was, according to some drivers, more straightforward about tipping and a had flat delivery pay regardless of size, distance, or complexity of the order. The company also shared that net pay to its drivers is about the same as it was under the old model.\\n\\nI found the percentage breakdown really interesting, but not surprising.\\n\\nBased on everything I've seen here and my own limited experience delivering on DD, I think it's laughable that DD claims about 80% of their workers favor the new pay model better and make about the same amount of money.... \\n\\nYeah, maybe that's true if the only workers surveyed are the executives who came up with the pay model change in the first place....\", \"polarity\": 0.1306750541125541, \"subjectivity\": 0.43403341450216454}, {\"title\": \"I\\u2019m dying \\ud83d\\ude02\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"title\": \"So, tell me if I got this \\\"Uber Pro\\\" thing right ..\", \"text\": \"You get gold.

I took a long hiatus from giving pax rides because food delivery is much better. If you drive an old car, you will drive it to the ground with either Lyft, Uber or food delivery. If you have a very new car, each mile removes resale value from it until you hit 60,000 miles, lose your factory warranty and dealers will offer you $1,000 for it or less. Be smart and make those miles count. \\n\\nPick up and drop off points: Lyft/Uber hide the exact pickup location until you accept. They hide the drop off location until you arrive to pick up. This forces you to end up in undesired areas for undesired amounts of money. Doordash is open and clear about these locations and even provides you a good estimate of trip mileage BEFORE you accept the gig. \\n\\nPay: Uber/Lyft pay cents per mile. That\\u2019s your \\u201cguarantee\\u201d. If you drive 5 miles, you\\u2019ll make about $4.00 plus the 10 cents a minute that nobody benefits from. When you accept the gig you have absolutely no idea if it\\u2019ll end up a mini $2.50 trip. When you accept a Grubhub gig you see upfront what your guaranteed pay is and it\\u2019s is not uncommon to get paid even $10 per mile. In Lyft/Uber tips can increase your profit but it\\u2019s a complete gamble risking the mileage on your car.  Some food delivery companies guarantee you $9 an hour. \\n\\nLiability: Driving drugged, drunk, or crazy (etc) pax, vs driving a box of pizza. With food delivery you save yourself from being sued, stabbed, puked, etc. \\n\\nCompetition: Uber/Lyft are 100% constantly hiring new drivers to compete with you and leave you hours without a ping. Grubhub and Doordash have a set headcount and they don\\u2019t always have open hiring. \\n\\nCar requirements: for Uber/Lyft you have to have a recent model car or truck with four seats and four doors. No salvage or rebuilt title. Food delivery has no requirements. You can use your motorcycle, bicycle or el Camino. They won\\u2019t suspend you if you report an accident. I do recommend you drive something good in MPG. \\n\\nHealth: this one is just my opinion but a busy day driving with pax is very unhealthy because you\\u2019re sitting for hours straight.  Food delivery requires you to get out of your vehicle to enter the restaurant then you have to either walk to knock on the customer\\u2019s door or even jog around an apartment building to get to the customer\\u2019s door. A bit of a burden but makes a huge positive for your health. \\n\\nFinally, and this may be considered the dark but lucrative side of food delivery, multi apping. If you\\u2019re smart and learn how to hustle, you can double or triple your profit by delivering for competing delivery companies simultaneously.\\n\\nNote that I never mentioned Uber Delivery or Postmates as food delivery companies. That\\u2019s because they\\u2019re the absolute worst towards drivers.\", \"polarity\": 0.06420040743570156, \"subjectivity\": 0.559410491469315}, {\"title\": \"I'm here on the corner.\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"title\": \"First crazie of the month.\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.25, \"subjectivity\": 0.3333333333333333}, {\"title\": \"Was wandering around on Facebook when this popped up.\", \"text\": \"\", \"polarity\": 0.0, \"subjectivity\": 0.0}, {\"title\": \"Oh, you meant the totally unmarked restaurant.

(Or, why you should turn your DD/foil-line bag inside out for cold food)\", \"text\": \"I've seen a lot of people who seem to misunderstand how the hot-bags lined with aluminum foil on the inside work, usually stating they are cheap ineffective bags. Lets have a quick science lesson about heat transfer.\\n\\nIn day-to-day life there are 3 types of heat transfer that affect us the most. These are:\\n\\n#1. Conduction: This is heat transfer through contact. Think of a pot sitting on a stove.\\n\\n#2. Convection: This is heat transfer through pressure induced flow of a fluid or gas. Think \\\"hot air rises, cold air falls\\\".\\n\\n#3. Radiant: This is Infrared light radiation (IR). It's heat in the form of light. Think heat-lamps at restaurant food counters, and when items glow orange when hot. This is how you can feel the heat of something from a distance instantly, without being above it to feel the hot air.\\n\\nWhen it comes to hot bags there are two main types in common use.\\n\\nA) Those with thick foam insulation. These mainly focus on reducing conductive heat transfer to air that comes in contact with the bag (heat transfer type #1 above) as the foam is full of air and won't conduct heat through the material very well. Grub-hub gives out these types of bags.\\n\\nB) Those with a inner foil lining. These focus on reducing radiant heat transfer (#3 above). These reflect the IR light/heat radiating off the food back into the food. This is the type of bag that DoorDash gives out. Aluminim foil is a very good IR reflector (up to 97% reflectivity for IR wavelengths). These are usually thinner, but are still effective as they focus on a different type of heat transfer from bag type A.\\n\\nEither type works equally as well on preventing convective heat transfer just by zipping it up tight (but this holds in steam and makes crispy food soggy). \\n\\nThe best type of bag is one that is good a preventing both radiant and conductive heat transfer, but you rarely see one with both thick insulation and a foil lining.\\n\\nFor most orders you will have hot food and you will want to keep the heat in, so either type being used as designed is correct. However, if you are trying to keep something cold this can change how you want to use the bag.\\n\\nBag type A: For these they will work equally as well for keeping food cold as it will for hot as it reduces conductive heat transfer just as well in either direction.\\n\\nBag type B: For foil lined bags with cold food the best thing to do is turn the bag inside-out so the foil lining is on the outside. The reason for this is there is no such thing as \\\"keeping the cold in\\\". Heat always moves from hotter concentrations to colder concentrations. Remember that cold is nothing but the absence of heat. All matter above Absolute Zero loses heat through emittance of IR light, and to keep something at a constant temperature you have to reflect the IR back to the direction of the source of heat. You want to reflect the IR away from what you want to keep cold. The metallic foil should always face the direction of heat so as to reflect the IR away from the cold food. This is the idea behind \\\"radiant barrier\\\" used in industry and construction, which is used to reflect heat from the sun away from the interior of a building (the sun transfers heat to us through radiation) and why aluminum and white-top roofs are regaining popularity. Having the foil on the inside of the bag for cold food does nothing to keep it cold and actually would be detrimental.\\n\\n\\nMoral of the story: If you have a foil lined hot bag turn it inside-out for cold food.\\n\\n\", \"polarity\": 0.012469765684051407, \"subjectivity\": 0.5563340891912322}, {\"title\": \"When pax ask if you want to hang out.

Offers to buy me a slice if we stop.  Gets pseudo-offended when I decline her offer.  Other friends not really engaging in that part of conversation.   She even says she'll give me an extra $5 to go back and get a slice after, very intent.  I actually might have stopped for the pizza of course, but I couldn't keep the meter running for 20 min, and couldn't figure out how the fare would work. Since I was their Uber driver afterall!!

I wanted to take the opportunity to leave some of my findings to others who may be considering driving and also hopefully give some insight to seasoned drivers who are probably better educated than I am.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhy did I join lyft/uber?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI have been unemployed for 6 months and ran out of unemployment benefits, I wasn't a big fan of doing this as It was a bit outside of my comfort zone but was encouraged by family and financial-need to do it and since I enjoy meeting new people and I drive a LUX car we thought I could make some \\\"get-by\\\" money. This would also allow me to interview and take phone calls at odd times during business hours. whereas a part-time job would have made that a lot harder and this was meant as a stop-gap measure from the beginning.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI also have a newborn that wakes me up in the ass crack of the morning, i thought I could use that dead time (and I mean dead time) to get out and do airport rides for big bucks. I had order lyfts before to take me to the airport and paid a shit ton so I figure, this could be the way to make money.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHow long did I drive?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNot long, 2 months to be precise, just enough to qualify for both Lyft and Uber sign up bonus ($1450 / 185 for lyft and $2400 for 300 rides with Uber). I started with Lyft at first as I had heard more positive things about the company that uber, the bonus as easier to attain and I didnt know any better hehe.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat did I learn?\\n\\nThis may come to a surprise as the first thing I mention, but, what I am realizing here is that, I dont think LYFT or Uber will ever turn a profit. They dont pay the drivers that high of a percentage of what they charge and even if they started using driverless cars, the amount they would spend on maintenance and care would wipe out most of the earnings. In other words, removing the minimum wage workers is not going to make all that much of a difference in a balance sheet.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMcdonalds makes money not because they are now using touchpad order machines, but because they have the right pricing model figured out. If they fired all of MCds employees, is not like they would triple in size all of sudden.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBack to driving. LUX or \\\"fancy rides\\\" as I like to call them, far and few between at least in my market. I did 7 in 2 months and I remember every and each one of them. I did a few more with uber 13 to be exact but in a shorter period of time as well. I should mention here, that LUX rides are the only way to really make money.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUnionizing is the only way drivers will win this one. Basically, as a driver, your best hope is for Lyft to stop all advertising and move those dollars to pay drivers more and have the drivers become the advertisers by offering great service. In order for that to happen the drivers need collective bargaining power and you don't get that unless you get together.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDrivers depend to much on tips, and thats not ok. this is my personal opinion as I am in general not a fan of the tipping culture we live in. But the fact is that, I almost salivate for tips and to be frank its just not a sustainable model for workers.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHow much did I make?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nExactly $3400. To add more context I live in a mid-size west coast city. 15% of that was on tips.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd spend?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell, this one is a bit tough, but if we are just talking Gas I spend $500\\\\~ because I also drive for personal reasons, its unfair to compare it dollar for dollar, but that's about what I attribute to rideshare. I also put 2540 miles on the car. I haven't calculated depreciation but I am assuming it's in the hundreds thought not much. I had to replace my tires as they were getting close to the 50k mark, while I can't completely attribute that to lyft, it definitely exacerbated the use and push that purchase sooner at a time where cash is short.  I did a 50k service check on my car that set me back $300 and that's it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWould I recommend it?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTheres three kinds of people that should drive IMO and actually come out ahead.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. People with odd work hours and free time during 6am - 8am and 4pm  - 7pm during the week and/or weekend nights.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2. Immigrants that struggle with other employment opportunities. Im just gonna be real here for a moment. I am an immigrant myself though with a masters degree and have lived in the US since I was 16. The truth is, this is the kind of job that works just enough for newcomers with poor language or labor skills. Driving 50 hour weeks should walk you out with $1000\\\\~ in revenue (notice i said revenue not profit) which is probably more than you could make anywhere else or until you can make connections and find a real job.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n3. Retirees. Yeah, If you have SS or use your retirement funds to live and have some free time, drive! when money is not an issue, this is a great way to get out, talk to people about the good ol days and just pass the time. I met lots of interesting people driving and that was the part of the work I enjoyed the most.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI don't seem to fit this criteria, why did I do it?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOne word CASHFLOW, essentially driving allowed me to take money from my car and put it in my pocket at a time where bills were pilling up.
